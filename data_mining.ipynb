       "'ACT I. Scene I.\\nVerona. A public place.\\n\\nEnter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house\\nof Capulet.\\n\\n\\n  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we\\'ll not carry coals.\\n\\n  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.\\n\\n  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we\\'ll draw.\\n\\n  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.\\n\\n  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.\\n\\n  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\\n\\n  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\\n\\n  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\\n    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn\\'st away.\\n\\n  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\\n    the wall of any man or maid of Montague\\'s.\\n\\n  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\\n    wall.\\n\\n  Samp. \\'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\\n    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague\\'s men\\n    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\\n\\n  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\\n\\n  Samp. \\'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have\\n    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off\\n    their heads.\\n\\n  Greg. The heads of the maids?\\n\\n  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\\n    Take it in what sense thou wilt.\\n\\n  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.\\n\\n  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and \\'tis known I\\n    am a pretty piece of flesh.\\n\\n  Greg. \\'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst\\n    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of\\n    Montagues.\\n\\n           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].\\n\\n\\n  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.\\n\\n  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?\\n\\n  Samp. Fear me not.\\n\\n  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!\\n\\n  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\\n\\n  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\\n\\n  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is\\n    disgrace to them, if they bear it.\\n\\n  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\n  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\n  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\n  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?\\n\\n  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.\\n\\n  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my\\n    thumb, sir.\\n\\n  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?\\n\\n  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\\n\\n  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as\\n    you.\\n\\n  Abr. No better.\\n\\n  Samp. Well, sir.\\n\\n                        Enter Benvolio.\\n\\n\\n  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say \\'better.\\' Here comes one of my\\n    master\\'s kinsmen.\\n\\n  Samp. Yes, better, sir.\\n\\n  Abr. You lie.\\n\\n  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.\\n                                                     They fight.\\n\\n  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]\\n    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.\\n\\n                          Enter Tybalt.\\n\\n\\n  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\\n    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.\\n\\n  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,\\n    Or manage it to part these men with me.\\n\\n  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\\n    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.\\n    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.\\n\\n     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or\\n                          partisans.\\n\\n\\n  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!\\n\\n  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\\n\\n           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.\\n\\n\\n  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\\n\\n  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\\n\\n  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come\\n    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.\\n\\n                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.\\n\\n\\n  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.\\n\\n  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\\n\\n                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.\\n\\n\\n  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\\n    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-\\n    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\\n    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\n    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!\\n    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\n    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground\\n    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\n    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word\\n    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\n    Have thrice disturb\\'d the quiet of our streets\\n    And made Verona\\'s ancient citizens\\n    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments\\n    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\n    Cank\\'red with peace, to part your cank\\'red hate.\\n    If ever you disturb our streets again,\\n    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\n    For this time all the rest depart away.\\n    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;\\n    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,\\n    To know our farther pleasure in this case,\\n    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.\\n    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\n              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].\\n\\n  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\n    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\n\\n  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary\\n    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\n    I drew to part them. In the instant came\\n    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar\\'d;\\n    Which, as he breath\\'d defiance to my ears,\\n    He swung about his head and cut the winds,\\n    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss\\'d him in scorn.\\n    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\\n    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\\n    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.\\n\\n  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?\\n    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\\n\\n  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp\\'d sun\\n    Peer\\'d forth the golden window of the East,\\n    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\\n    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore\\n    That westward rooteth from the city\\'s side,\\n    So early walking did I see your son.\\n    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me\\n    And stole into the covert of the wood.\\n    I- measuring his affections by my own,\\n    Which then most sought where most might not be found,\\n    Being one too many by my weary self-\\n    Pursu\\'d my humour, not Pursuing his,\\n    And gladly shunn\\'d who gladly fled from me.\\n\\n  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,\\n    With tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew,\\n    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\n    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\n    Should in the furthest East bean to draw\\n    The shady curtains from Aurora\\'s bed,\\n    Away from light steals home my heavy son\\n    And private in his chamber pens himself,\\n    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight\\n    And makes himself an artificial night.\\n    Black and portentous must this humour prove\\n    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\n\\n  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\n  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him\\n\\n  Ben. Have you importun\\'d him by any means?\\n\\n  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;\\n    But he, his own affections\\' counsellor,\\n    Is to himself- I will not say how true-\\n    But to himself so secret and so close,\\n    So far from sounding and discovery,\\n    As is the bud bit with an envious worm\\n    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\\n    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\n    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\n    We would as willingly give cure as know.\\n\\n                       Enter Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,\\n    I\\'ll know his grievance, or be much denied.\\n\\n  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\n    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let\\'s away,\\n                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].\\n\\n  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.\\n\\n  Rom. Is the day so young?\\n\\n  Ben. But new struck nine.\\n\\n  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.\\n    Was that my father that went hence so fast?\\n\\n  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo\\'s hours?\\n\\n  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.\\n\\n  Ben. In love?\\n\\n  Rom. Out-\\n\\n  Ben. Of love?\\n\\n  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.\\n\\n  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,\\n    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\\n\\n  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\n    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!\\n    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\\n    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\n    Here\\'s much to do with hate, but more with love.\\n    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\n    O anything, of nothing first create!\\n    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\n    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\n    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\n    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is\\n    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\n    Dost thou not laugh?\\n\\n  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.\\n\\n  Rom. Good heart, at what?\\n\\n  Ben. At thy good heart\\'s oppression.\\n\\n  Rom. Why, such is love\\'s transgression.\\n    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\n    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\\n    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\n    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\n    Love is a smoke rais\\'d with the fume of sighs;\\n    Being purg\\'d, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes;\\n    Being vex\\'d, a sea nourish\\'d with lovers\\' tears.\\n    What is it else? A madness most discreet,\\n    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\n    Farewell, my coz.\\n\\n  Ben. Soft! I will go along.\\n    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\n\\n  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:\\n    This is not Romeo, he\\'s some other where.\\n\\n  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?\\n\\n  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?\\n\\n  Ben. Groan? Why, no;\\n    But sadly tell me who.\\n\\n  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.\\n    Ah, word ill urg\\'d to one that is so ill!\\n    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\n\\n  Ben. I aim\\'d so near when I suppos\\'d you lov\\'d.\\n\\n  Rom. A right good markman! And she\\'s fair I love.\\n\\n  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\n\\n  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She\\'ll not be hit\\n    With Cupid\\'s arrow. She hath Dian\\'s wit,\\n    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm\\'d,\\n    From Love\\'s weak childish bow she lives unharm\\'d.\\n    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,\\n    Nor bide th\\' encounter of assailing eyes,\\n    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\\n    O, she\\'s rich in beauty; only poor\\n    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\n\\n  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\n\\n  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\n    For beauty, starv\\'d with her severity,\\n    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\\n    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\\n    To merit bliss by making me despair.\\n    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\\n    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\\n\\n  Ben. Be rul\\'d by me: forget to think of her.\\n\\n  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\\n\\n  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.\\n    Examine other beauties.\\n\\n  Rom. \\'Tis the way\\n    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.\\n    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies\\' brows,\\n    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.\\n    He that is strucken blind cannot forget\\n    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\\n    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\\n    What doth her beauty serve but as a note\\n    Where I may read who pass\\'d that passing fair?\\n    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\\n\\n  Ben. I\\'ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene II.\\nA Street.\\n\\nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.\\n\\n\\n  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,\\n    In penalty alike; and \\'tis not hard, I think,\\n    For men so old as we to keep the peace.\\n\\n  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,\\n    And pity \\'tis you liv\\'d at odds so long.\\n    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\\n\\n  Cap. But saying o\\'er what I have said before:\\n    My child is yet a stranger in the world,\\n    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\\n    Let two more summers wither in their pride\\n    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\\n\\n  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.\\n\\n  Cap. And too soon marr\\'d are those so early made.\\n    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\\n    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.\\n    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\\n    My will to her consent is but a part.\\n    An she agree, within her scope of choice\\n    Lies my consent and fair according voice.\\n    This night I hold an old accustom\\'d feast,\\n    Whereto I have invited many a guest,\\n    Such as I love; and you among the store,\\n    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\\n    At my poor house look to behold this night\\n    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\\n    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel\\n    When well apparell\\'d April on the heel\\n    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight\\n    Among fresh female buds shall you this night\\n    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\\n    And like her most whose merit most shall be;\\n    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,\\n    May stand in number, though in reck\\'ning none.\\n    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,\\n    sirrah, trudge about\\n    Through fair Verona; find those persons out\\n    Whose names are written there, and to them say,\\n    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-\\n                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].\\n\\n  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written\\n    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor\\n    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter\\n    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are\\n    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person\\n    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!\\n\\n                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another\\'s burning;\\n    One pain is lessoned by another\\'s anguish;\\n    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\\n    One desperate grief cures with another\\'s languish.\\n    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\\n    And the rank poison of the old will die.\\n\\n  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.\\n\\n  Ben. For what, I pray thee?\\n\\n  Rom. For your broken shin.\\n\\n  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?\\n\\n  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;\\n    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,\\n    Whipp\\'d and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.\\n\\n  Serv. God gi\\' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\\n\\n  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.\\n\\n  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can\\n    you read anything you see?\\n\\n  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.\\n\\n  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!\\n\\n  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.\\n\\n      \\'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\\n      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\\n      The lady widow of Vitruvio;\\n      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;\\n      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;\\n      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\\n      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\\n      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;\\n      Lucio and the lively Helena.\\'\\n\\n    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they\\n    come?\\n\\n  Serv. Up.\\n\\n  Rom. Whither?\\n\\n  Serv. To supper, to our house.\\n\\n  Rom. Whose house?\\n\\n  Serv. My master\\'s.\\n\\n  Rom. Indeed I should have ask\\'d you that before.\\n\\n  Serv. Now I\\'ll tell you without asking. My master is the great\\n    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray\\n    come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.\\n\\n  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet\\'s\\n    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov\\'st;\\n    With all the admired beauties of Verona.\\n    Go thither, and with unattainted eye\\n    Compare her face with some that I shall show,\\n    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\\n\\n  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye\\n    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;\\n    And these, who, often drown\\'d, could never die,\\n    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!\\n    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\\n    Ne\\'er saw her match since first the world begun.\\n\\n  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,\\n    Herself pois\\'d with herself in either eye;\\n    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh\\'d\\n    Your lady\\'s love against some other maid\\n    That I will show you shining at this feast,\\n    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.\\n\\n  Rom. I\\'ll go along, no such sight to be shown,\\n    But to rejoice in splendour of my own.

Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\\n    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!\\n    God forbid! Where\\'s this girl? What, Juliet!\\n\\n                         Enter Juliet.\\n\\n\\n  Jul. How now? Who calls?\\n\\n  Nurse. Your mother.\\n\\n  Jul. Madam, I am here.\\n    What is your will?\\n\\n  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,\\n    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;\\n    I have rememb\\'red me, thou\\'s hear our counsel.\\n    Thou knowest my daughter\\'s of a pretty age.\\n\\n  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\\n\\n  Wife. She\\'s not fourteen.\\n\\n  Nurse. I\\'ll lay fourteen of my teeth-\\n    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\\n    She is not fourteen. How long is it now\\n    To Lammastide?\\n\\n  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.\\n\\n  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\\n    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\\n    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\\n    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\\n    She was too good for me. But, as I said,\\n    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\\n    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\\n    \\'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\\n    And she was wean\\'d (I never shall forget it),\\n    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;\\n    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\\n    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\\n    My lord and you were then at Mantua.\\n    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\\n    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\\n    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\\n    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\\n    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! \\'Twas no need, I trow,\\n    To bid me trudge.\\n    And since that time it is eleven years,\\n    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th\\' rood,\\n    She could have run and waddled all about;\\n    For even the day before, she broke her brow;\\n    And then my husband (God be with his soul!\\n    \\'A was a merry man) took up the child.\\n    \\'Yea,\\' quoth he, \\'dost thou fall upon thy face?\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' and, by my holidam,\\n    The pretty wretch left crying, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\n    To see now how a jest shall come about!\\n    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\\n    I never should forget it. \\'Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' quoth he,\\n    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\n\\n  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\\n\\n  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\\n    To think it should leave crying and say \\'Ay.\\'\\n    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow\\n    A bump as big as a young cock\\'rel\\'s stone;\\n    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\\n    \\'Yea,\\' quoth my husband, \\'fall\\'st upon thy face?\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?\\' It stinted, and said \\'Ay.\\'\\n\\n  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\\n\\n  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\\n    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e\\'er I nurs\\'d.\\n    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\\n\\n  Wife. Marry, that \\'marry\\' is the very theme\\n    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\\n    How stands your disposition to be married?\\n\\n  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\\n\\n  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\\n    I would say thou hadst suck\\'d wisdom from thy teat.\\n\\n  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\\n    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\\n    Are made already mothers. By my count,\\n    I was your mother much upon these years\\n    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\\n    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\\n\\n  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\\n    As all the world- why he\\'s a man of wax.\\n\\n  Wife. Verona\\'s summer hath not such a flower.\\n\\n  Nurse. Nay, he\\'s a flower, in faith- a very flower.\\n\\n  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\\n    This night you shall behold him at our feast.\\n    Read o\\'er the volume of young Paris\\' face,\\n    And find delight writ there with beauty\\'s pen;\\n    Examine every married lineament,\\n    And see how one another lends content;\\n    And what obscur\\'d in this fair volume lies\\n    Find written in the margent of his eyes,\\n    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,\\n    To beautify him only lacks a cover.\\n    The fish lives in the sea, and \\'tis much pride\\n    For fair without the fair within to hide.\\n    That book in many\\'s eyes doth share the glory,\\n    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\\n    So shall you share all that he doth possess,\\n    By having him making yourself no less.\\n\\n  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men\\n\\n  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris\\' love?\\n\\n  Jul. I\\'ll look to like, if looking liking move;\\n    But no more deep will I endart mine eye\\n    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\\n\\n                        Enter Servingman.\\n\\n\\n  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv\\'d up, you call\\'d,\\n    my young lady ask\\'d for, the nurse curs\\'d in the pantry, and\\n    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you\\n    follow straight.\\n\\n  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].\\n    Juliet, the County stays.\\n\\n  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene IV.\\nA street.\\n\\nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;\\nTorchbearers.\\n\\n\\n  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\\n    Or shall we on without apology?\\n\\n  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.\\n    We\\'ll have no Cupid hoodwink\\'d with a scarf,\\n    Bearing a Tartar\\'s painted bow of lath,\\n    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;\\n    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\\n    After the prompter, for our entrance;\\n    But, let them measure us by what they will,\\n    We\\'ll measure them a measure, and be gone.\\n\\n  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\\n    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.\\n\\n  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\\n\\n  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\\n    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\\n    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\\n\\n  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid\\'s wings\\n    And soar with them above a common bound.\\n\\n  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\\n    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound\\n    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\\n    Under love\\'s heavy burthen do I sink.\\n\\n  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-\\n    Too great oppression for a tender thing.\\n\\n  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,\\n    Too rude, too boist\\'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\\n\\n  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.\\n    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\\n    Give me a case to put my visage in.\\n    A visor for a visor! What care I\\n    What curious eye doth quote deformities?\\n    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\\n\\n  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in\\n    But every man betake him to his legs.\\n\\n  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart\\n    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\\n    For I am proverb\\'d with a grandsire phrase,\\n    I\\'ll be a candle-holder and look on;\\n    The game was ne\\'er so fair, and I am done.\\n\\n  Mer. Tut! dun\\'s the mouse, the constable\\'s own word!\\n    If thou art Dun, we\\'ll draw thee from the mire\\n    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick\\'st\\n    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\\n\\n  Rom. Nay, that\\'s not so.\\n\\n  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay\\n    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\\n    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\\n    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.\\n\\n  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;\\n    But \\'tis no wit to go.\\n\\n  Mer. Why, may one ask?\\n\\n  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.\\n\\n  Mer. And so did I.\\n\\n  Rom. Well, what was yours?\\n\\n  Mer. That dreamers often lie.\\n\\n  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\\n\\n  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\\n    She is the fairies\\' midwife, and she comes\\n    In shape no bigger than an agate stone\\n    On the forefinger of an alderman,\\n    Drawn with a team of little atomies\\n    Athwart men\\'s noses as they lie asleep;\\n    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners\\' legs,\\n    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\\n    Her traces, of the smallest spider\\'s web;\\n    Her collars, of the moonshine\\'s wat\\'ry beams;\\n    Her whip, of cricket\\'s bone; the lash, of film;\\n    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\\n    Not half so big as a round little worm\\n    Prick\\'d from the lazy finger of a maid;\\n    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\\n    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\\n    Time out o\\' mind the fairies\\' coachmakers.\\n    And in this state she \\'gallops night by night\\n    Through lovers\\' brains, and then they dream of love;\\n    O\\'er courtiers\\' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\\n    O\\'er lawyers\\' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\\n    O\\'er ladies\\' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\\n    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\\n    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\\n    Sometime she gallops o\\'er a courtier\\'s nose,\\n    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\\n    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig\\'s tail\\n    Tickling a parson\\'s nose as \\'a lies asleep,\\n    Then dreams he of another benefice.\\n    Sometimes she driveth o\\'er a soldier\\'s neck,\\n    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\\n    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\\n    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon\\n    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\\n    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\\n    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\\n    That plats the manes of horses in the night\\n    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\\n    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes\\n    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\\n    That presses them and learns them first to bear,\\n    Making them women of good carriage.\\n    This is she-\\n\\n  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\\n    Thou talk\\'st of nothing.\\n\\n  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;\\n    Which are the children of an idle brain,\\n    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;\\n    Which is as thin of substance as the air,\\n    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\\n    Even now the frozen bosom of the North\\n    And, being anger\\'d, puffs away from thence,\\n    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.\\n\\n  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\\n    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\\n\\n  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\\n    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\\n    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\\n    With this night\\'s revels and expire the term\\n    Of a despised life, clos\\'d in my breast,\\n    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.\\n    But he that hath the steerage of my course\\n    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!\\n\\n  Ben. Strike, drum.\\n                           They march about the stage.

She that makes dainty,\\n    She I\\'ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?\\n    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\\n    That I have worn a visor and could tell\\n    A whispering tale in a fair lady\\'s ear,\\n    Such as would please. \\'Tis gone, \\'tis gone, \\'tis gone!\\n    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.\\n    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.\\n                                    Music plays, and they dance.\\n    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,\\n    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.\\n    Ah, sirrah, this unlook\\'d-for sport comes well.\\n    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,\\n    For you and I are past our dancing days.\\n    How long is\\'t now since last yourself and I\\n    Were in a mask?\\n  2.

Cap. \\'Tis more, \\'tis more! His son is elder, sir;\\n    His son is thirty.\\n\\n  Cap. Will you tell me that?\\n    His son was but a ward two years ago.\\n\\n  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady\\'s that, which doth enrich the\\n    hand Of yonder knight?\\n\\n  Serv. I know not, sir.\\n\\n  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\\n    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\\n    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop\\'s ear-\\n    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\\n    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\\n    As yonder lady o\\'er her fellows shows.\\n    The measure done, I\\'ll watch her place of stand\\n    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\\n    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\\n    For I ne\\'er saw true beauty till this night.\\n\\n  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.\\n    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave\\n    Come hither, cover\\'d with an antic face,\\n    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\\n    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,\\n    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\\n\\n  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\\n\\n  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\\n    A villain, that is hither come in spite\\n    To scorn at our solemnity this night.\\n\\n  Cap. Young Romeo is it?\\n\\n  Tyb. \\'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\\n\\n  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.\\n    \\'A bears him like a portly gentleman,\\n    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\\n    To be a virtuous and well-govern\\'d youth.\\n    I would not for the wealth of all this town\\n    Here in my house do him disparagement.\\n    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.\\n    It is my will; the which if thou respect,\\n    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\\n    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\\n\\n  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.\\n    I\\'ll not endure him.\\n\\n  Cap. He shall be endur\\'d.\\n    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!\\n    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!\\n    You\\'ll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!\\n    You\\'ll make a mutiny among my guests!\\n    You will set cock-a-hoop! you\\'ll be the man!\\n\\n  Tyb. Why, uncle, \\'tis a shame.\\n\\n  Cap. Go to, go to!\\n    You are a saucy boy. Is\\'t so, indeed?\\n    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.\\n    You must contrary me!

Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting\\n    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\\n    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,\\n    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt\\'rest gall.          Exit.\\n\\n  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand\\n    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:\\n    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\\n    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\\n\\n  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\\n    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\\n    For saints have hands that pilgrims\\' hands do touch,\\n    And palm to palm is holy palmers\\' kiss.\\n\\n  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\\n\\n  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray\\'r.\\n\\n  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!\\n    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\\n\\n  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers\\' sake.\\n\\n  Rom. Then move not while my prayer\\'s effect I take.\\n    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg\\'d.  [Kisses her.]\\n\\n  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.\\n\\n  Rom.

Nay, I\\'ll conjure too.\\n    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!\\n    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;\\n    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!\\n    Cry but \\'Ay me!\\' pronounce but \\'love\\' and \\'dove\\';\\n    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,\\n    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,\\n    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim\\n    When King Cophetua lov\\'d the beggar maid!\\n    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;\\n    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.\\n    I conjure thee by Rosaline\\'s bright eyes.\\n    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,\\n    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,\\n    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,\\n    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!\\n\\n  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.\\n\\n  Mer. This cannot anger him. \\'Twould anger him\\n    To raise a spirit in his mistress\\' circle\\n    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand\\n    Till she had laid it and conjur\\'d it down.\\n    That were some spite; my invocation\\n    Is fair and honest: in his mistress\\' name,\\n    I conjure only but to raise up him.\\n\\n  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees\\n    To be consorted with the humorous night.\\n    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.\\n\\n  Mer.

Cast it off.\\n    It is my lady; O, it is my love!\\n    O that she knew she were!\\n    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\\n    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.\\n    I am too bold; \\'tis not to me she speaks.\\n    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\\n    Having some business, do entreat her eyes\\n    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.\\n    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?\\n    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\\n    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\\n    Would through the airy region stream so bright\\n    That birds would sing and think it were not night.\\n    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\\n    O that I were a glove upon that hand,\\n    That I might touch that cheek!\\n\\n  Jul.

O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\\n    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!\\n    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\\n    And I\\'ll no longer be a Capulet.\\n\\n  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\\n\\n  Jul. \\'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\\n    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\\n    What\\'s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\\n    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part\\n    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!\\n    What\\'s in a name? That which we call a rose\\n    By any other name would smell as sweet.\\n    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call\\'d,\\n    Retain that dear perfection which he owes\\n    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;\\n    And for that name, which is no part of thee,\\n    Take all myself.\\n\\n  Rom. I take thee at thy word.\\n    Call me but love, and I\\'ll be new baptiz\\'d;\\n    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\\n\\n  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen\\'d in night,\\n    So stumblest on my counsel?\\n\\n  Rom. By a name\\n    I know not how to tell thee who I am.\\n    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\\n    Because it is an enemy to thee.\\n    Had I it written, I would tear the word.\\n\\n  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\\n    Of that tongue\\'s utterance, yet I know the sound.\\n    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\\n\\n  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\\n\\n  Jul. How cam\\'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\\n    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\\n    And the place death, considering who thou art,\\n    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.\\n\\n  Rom. With love\\'s light wings did I o\\'erperch these walls;\\n    For stony limits cannot hold love out,\\n    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.\\n    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\\n\\n  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.\\n\\n  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\\n    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,\\n    And I am proof against their enmity.\\n\\n  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.\\n\\n  Rom.

By whose direction found\\'st thou out this place?\\n\\n  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.\\n    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\\n    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\\n    As that vast shore wash\\'d with the farthest sea,\\n    I would adventure for such merchandise.\\n\\n  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\\n    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\\n    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\\n    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny\\n    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\\n    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say \\'Ay\\';\\n    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear\\'st,\\n    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers\\' perjuries,\\n    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\\n    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\\n    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\\n    I\\'ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\\n    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\\n    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\\n    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\\n    But trust me, gentleman, I\\'ll prove more true\\n    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\\n    I should have been more strange, I must confess,\\n    But that thou overheard\\'st, ere I was ware,\\n    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\\n    And not impute this yielding to light love,\\n    Which the dark night hath so discovered.\\n\\n  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\\n    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\\n\\n  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th\\' inconstant moon,\\n    That monthly changes in her circled orb,\\n    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\\n\\n  Rom. What shall I swear by?\\n\\n  Jul. Do not swear at all;\\n    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\\n    Which is the god of my idolatry,\\n    And I\\'ll believe thee.\\n\\n  Rom. If my heart\\'s dear love-\\n\\n  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\\n    I have no joy of this contract to-night.\\n    It is too rash, too unadvis\\'d, too sudden;\\n    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be\\n    Ere one can say \\'It lightens.\\' Sweet, good night!\\n    This bud of love, by summer\\'s ripening breath,\\n    May prove a beauteous flow\\'r when next we meet.\\n    Good night, good night!

Th\\' exchange of thy love\\'s faithful vow for mine.\\n\\n  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\\n    And yet I would it were to give again.\\n\\n  Rom. Would\\'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\\n\\n  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.\\n    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.\\n    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,\\n    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,\\n    The more I have, for both are infinite.\\n    I hear some noise within.

I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\\n    Rememb\\'ring how I love thy company.\\n\\n  Rom. And I\\'ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\\n    Forgetting any other home but this.\\n\\n  Jul. \\'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-\\n    And yet no farther than a wanton\\'s bird,\\n    That lets it hop a little from her hand,\\n    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\\n    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\\n    So loving-jealous of his liberty.\\n\\n  Rom. I would I were thy bird.\\n\\n  Jul. Sweet, so would I.\\n    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\\n    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,\\n    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.\\n                                                         [Exit.]\\n\\n  Rom.

Good morrow, father.\\n\\n  Friar. Benedicite!\\n    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\\n    Young son, it argues a distempered head\\n    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\\n    Care keeps his watch in every old man\\'s eye,\\n    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;\\n    But where unbruised youth with unstuff\\'d brain\\n    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\\n    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure\\n    Thou art uprous\\'d with some distemp\\'rature;\\n    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-\\n    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.\\n\\n  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.\\n\\n  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?\\n\\n  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\\n    I have forgot that name, and that name\\'s woe.\\n\\n  Friar. That\\'s my good son! But where hast thou been then?\\n\\n  Rom.

Young men\\'s love then lies\\n    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\\n    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine\\n    Hath wash\\'d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\\n    How much salt water thrown away in waste,\\n    To season love, that of it doth not taste!\\n    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\\n    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.\\n    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\\n    Of an old tear that is not wash\\'d off yet.\\n    If e\\'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\\n    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.\\n    And art thou chang\\'d? Pronounce this sentence then:\\n    Women may fall when there\\'s no strength in men.\\n\\n  Rom. Thou chid\\'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\\n\\n  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\\n\\n  Rom. And bad\\'st me bury love.\\n\\n  Friar. Not in a grave\\n    To lay one in, another out to have.\\n\\n  Rom. I pray thee chide not.

Where the devil should this Romeo be?\\n    Came he not home to-night?\\n\\n  Ben. Not to his father\\'s. I spoke with his man.\\n\\n  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,\\n    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.\\n\\n  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,\\n    Hath sent a letter to his father\\'s house.\\n\\n  Mer. A challenge, on my life.\\n\\n  Ben. Romeo will answer it.\\n\\n  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.\\n\\n  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter\\'s master, how he dares,\\n    being dared.\\n\\n  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb\\'d with a white\\n    wench\\'s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the\\n    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy\\'s\\n    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?\\n\\n  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?\\n\\n  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he\\'s the\\n    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing\\n    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his\\n    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very\\n    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman\\n    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the\\n    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.\\n\\n  Ben. The what?\\n\\n  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-\\n    these new tuners of accent! \\'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very\\n    tall man! a very good whore!\\' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,\\n    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange\\n    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi\\'s, who stand\\n    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old\\n    bench? O, their bones, their bones!\\n\\n                               Enter Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!\\n\\n  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how\\n    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch\\n    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she\\n    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,\\n    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,\\n    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There\\'s a French\\n    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit\\n    fairly last night.\\n\\n  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\\n\\n  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\\n\\n  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a\\n    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.\\n\\n  Mer. That\\'s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a\\n    man to bow in the hams.\\n\\n  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.\\n\\n  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.\\n\\n  Rom. A most courteous exposition.\\n\\n  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\\n\\n  Rom. Pink for flower.\\n\\n  Mer. Right.\\n\\n  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower\\'d.\\n\\n  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out\\n    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may\\n    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.\\n\\n  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!\\n\\n  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.\\n\\n  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I\\'ll cry a match.\\n\\n  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for\\n    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am\\n    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\n\\n  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not\\n    there for the goose.\\n\\n  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\\n\\n  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!\\n\\n  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.\\n\\n  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv\\'d in to a sweet goose?\\n\\n  Mer. O, here\\'s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch\\n    narrow to an ell broad!\\n\\n  Rom. I stretch it out for that word \\'broad,\\' which, added to\\n    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\\n\\n  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now\\n    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by\\n    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a\\n    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in\\n    a hole.\\n\\n  Ben. Stop there, stop there!\\n\\n  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\n\\n  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\n\\n  Mer. O, thou art deceiv\\'d! I would have made it short; for I\\n    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to\\n    occupy the argument no longer.\\n\\n  Rom. Here\\'s goodly gear!\\n\\n                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].\\n\\n\\n  Mer. A sail, a sail!\\n\\n  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.\\n\\n  Nurse. Peter!\\n\\n  Peter.

God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\n\\n  Nurse. Is it good-den?\\n\\n  Mer. \\'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is\\n    now upon the prick of noon.\\n\\n  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!\\n\\n  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\n\\n  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. \\'For himself to mar,\\'\\n    quoth \\'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the\\n    young Romeo?\\n\\n  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you\\n    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest\\n    of that name, for fault of a worse.\\n\\n  Nurse. You say well.\\n\\n  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i\\' faith! wisely,\\n    wisely.\\n\\n  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\n\\n  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.\\n\\n  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\n\\n  Rom. What hast thou found?\\n\\n  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is\\n    something stale and hoar ere it be spent\\n                                     He walks by them and sings.\\n\\n                   An old hare hoar,\\n                   And an old hare hoar,\\n                Is very good meat in Lent;\\n                   But a hare that is hoar\\n                   Is too much for a score\\n                When it hoars ere it be spent.\\n\\n    Romeo, will you come to your father\\'s? We\\'ll to dinner thither.\\n\\n  Rom. I will follow you.\\n\\n  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady.

I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant\\n    was this that was so full of his ropery?\\n\\n  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and\\n    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\n\\n  Nurse. An \\'a speak anything against me, I\\'ll take him down, an\\n\\'a\\n    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,\\n    I\\'ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\\n    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\\n    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\\n\\n  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my\\n    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as\\n    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the\\n    law on my side.\\n\\n  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me\\n    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,\\n    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I\\n    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead\\n    her into a fool\\'s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of\\n    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and\\n    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\\n    an ill thing to be off\\'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.\\n\\n  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\n    thee-\\n\\n  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\\n    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.\\n\\n  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\n\\n  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\\n    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\\n\\n  Rom. Bid her devise\\n    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;\\n    And there she shall at Friar Laurence\\' cell\\n    Be shriv\\'d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\n\\n  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\\n\\n  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.\\n\\n  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\n\\n  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\n    Within this hour my man shall be with thee\\n    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\n    Which to the high topgallant of my joy\\n    Must be my convoy in the secret night.\\n    Farewell. Be trusty, and I\\'ll quit thy pains.\\n    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\\n\\n  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\\n\\n  Rom. What say\\'st thou, my dear nurse?\\n\\n  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne\\'er hear say,\\n    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?\\n\\n  Rom. I warrant thee my man\\'s as true as steel.\\n\\n  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!\\n    when \\'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in\\n    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,\\n    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I\\n    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;\\n    but I\\'ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\\n    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both\\n    with a letter?\\n\\n  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\n\\n  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that\\'s the dog\\'s name.

How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath\\n    To say to me that thou art out of breath?\\n    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay\\n    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\\n    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\\n    Say either, and I\\'ll stay the circumstance.\\n    Let me be satisfied, is\\'t good or bad?\\n\\n  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to\\n    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better\\n    than any man\\'s, yet his leg excels all men\\'s; and for a hand and a\\n    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk\\'d on, yet\\n    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I\\'ll\\n    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve\\nGod.\\n    What, have you din\\'d at home?\\n\\n  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.\\n    What says he of our marriage? What of that?\\n\\n  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\\n    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\\n    My back o\\' t\\' other side,- ah, my back, my back!\\n    Beshrew your heart for sending me about\\n    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!\\n\\n  Jul. I\\' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\\n    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?\\n\\n  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,\\n    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where\\n    is your mother?\\n\\n  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.\\n    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!\\n    \\'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\\n    \"Where is your mother?\"\\'\\n\\n  Nurse. O God\\'s Lady dear!\\n    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.\\n    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?\\n    Henceforward do your messages yourself.\\n\\n  Jul. Here\\'s such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?\\n\\n  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?\\n\\n  Jul. I have.\\n\\n  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence\\' cell;\\n    There stays a husband to make you a wife.\\n    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:\\n    They\\'ll be in scarlet straight at any news.\\n    Hie you to church; I must another way,\\n    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love\\n    Must climb a bird\\'s nest soon when it is dark.\\n    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\\n    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.\\n    Go; I\\'ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\\n\\n  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene VI.\\nFriar Laurence\\'s cell.\\n\\nEnter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act\\n    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!\\n\\n  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,\\n    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy\\n    That one short minute gives me in her sight.\\n    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,\\n    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-\\n    It is enough I may but call her mine.\\n\\n  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends\\n    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,\\n    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey\\n    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness\\n    And in the taste confounds the appetite.\\n    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\n    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\n\\n                     Enter Juliet.\\n\\n    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\n    Will ne\\'er wear out the everlasting flint.\\n    A lover may bestride the gossamer\\n    That idles in the wanton summer air,\\n    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\n\\n  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.\\n\\n  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\n\\n  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\n\\n  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\n    Be heap\\'d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\n    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\n    This neighbour air, and let rich music\\'s tongue\\n    Unfold the imagin\\'d happiness that both\\n    Receive in either by this dear encounter.\\n\\n  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,\\n    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.\\n    They are but beggars that can count their worth;\\n    But my true love is grown to such excess\\n    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\n\\n  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;\\n    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\n    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.\\n                                                       [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III. Scene I.\\nA public place.\\n\\nEnter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let\\'s retire.\\n    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.\\n    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\\n    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\\n\\n  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters\\n    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and\\n    says \\'God send me no need of thee!\\' and by the operation of the\\n    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.\\n\\n  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?\\n\\n  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in\\n    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be\\n    moved.\\n\\n  Ben. And what to?\\n\\n  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,\\n    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a\\n    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.\\n    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no\\n    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an\\n    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels\\n    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as\\n    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell\\'d with a\\n    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog\\n    that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a\\n    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with\\n    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\n    tutor me from quarrelling!\\n\\n  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should\\n    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\n\\n  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!\\n\\n                       Enter Tybalt and others.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.\\n\\n  Mer. By my heel, I care not.\\n\\n  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.\\n    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.\\n\\n  Mer. And but one word with one of us?\\n    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.\\n\\n  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me\\n    occasion.\\n\\n  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving\\n\\n  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\\n\\n  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make\\n    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here\\'s my\\n    fiddlestick; here\\'s that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\n\\n  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.\\n    Either withdraw unto some private place\\n    And reason coldly of your grievances,\\n    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.\\n\\n  Mer. Men\\'s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\n    I will not budge for no man\\'s pleasure,\\n\\n                        Enter Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.\\n\\n  Mer. But I\\'ll be hang\\'d, sir, if he wear your livery.\\n    Marry, go before to field, he\\'ll be your follower!\\n    Your worship in that sense may call him man.\\n\\n  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\n    No better term than this: thou art a villain.\\n\\n  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\n    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage\\n    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.\\n    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.\\n\\n  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\n    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.\\n\\n  Rom. I do protest I never injur\\'d thee,\\n    But love thee better than thou canst devise\\n    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;\\n    And so good Capulet, which name I tender\\n    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\n\\n  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\n    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]\\n    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?\\n\\n  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?\\n\\n  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.\\nThat I\\n    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,\\n\\n    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out\\n    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your\\n    ears ere it be out.\\n\\n  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]\\n\\n  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\\n\\n  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!\\n                                                   [They fight.]\\n\\n  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\\n    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!\\n    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\\n    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.\\n    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\\n         Tybalt under Romeo\\'s arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies\\n                                           [with his Followers].\\n\\n  Mer. I am hurt.\\n    A plague o\\' both your houses! I am sped.\\n    Is he gone and hath nothing?\\n\\n  Ben. What, art thou hurt?\\n\\n  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, \\'tis enough.\\n    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.\\n                                                    [Exit Page.]\\n\\n  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.\\n\\n  Mer. No, \\'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;\\n    but \\'tis enough, \\'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you\\n    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this\\n    world. A plague o\\' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a\\n    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,\\na\\n    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil\\n    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.\\n\\n  Rom. I thought all for the best.\\n\\n  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,\\n    Or I shall faint. A plague o\\' both your houses!\\n    They have made worms\\' meat of me. I have it,\\n    And soundly too. Your houses!\\n                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].\\n\\n  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince\\'s near ally,\\n    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt\\n    In my behalf- my reputation stain\\'d\\n    With Tybalt\\'s slander- Tybalt, that an hour\\n    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,\\n    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate\\n    And in my temper soft\\'ned valour\\'s steel\\n\\n                      Enter Benvolio.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio\\'s dead!\\n    That gallant spirit hath aspir\\'d the clouds,\\n    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.\\n\\n  Rom. This day\\'s black fate on moe days doth depend;\\n    This but begins the woe others must end.\\n\\n                       Enter Tybalt.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.\\n\\n  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\\n    Away to heaven respective lenity,\\n    And fire-ey\\'d fury be my conduct now!\\n    Now, Tybalt, take the \\'villain\\' back again\\n    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio\\'s soul\\n    Is but a little way above our heads,\\n    Staying for thine to keep him company.\\n    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.\\n\\n  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\\n    Shalt with him hence.\\n\\n  Rom. This shall determine that.\\n                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.\\n\\n  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!\\n    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\\n    Stand not amaz\\'d. The Prince will doom thee death\\n    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!\\n\\n  Rom. O, I am fortune\\'s fool!\\n\\n  Ben. Why dost thou stay?\\n                                                     Exit Romeo.\\n                      Enter Citizens.\\n\\n\\n  Citizen. Which way ran he that kill\\'d Mercutio?\\n    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?\\n\\n  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.\\n\\n  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.\\n    I charge thee in the Prince\\'s name obey.\\n\\n\\n  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,\\n                     and [others].\\n\\n\\n  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?\\n\\n  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all\\n    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.\\n    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\\n    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.\\n\\n  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother\\'s child!\\n    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill\\'d\\n    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\\n    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\\n    O cousin, cousin!\\n\\n  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?\\n\\n  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo\\'s hand did stay.\\n    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\\n    How nice the quarrel was, and urg\\'d withal\\n    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered\\n    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow\\'d-\\n    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\\n    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\n    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio\\'s breast;\\n    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\n    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\n    Cold death aside and with the other sends\\n    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\n    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\n    \\'Hold, friends! friends, part!\\' and swifter than his tongue,\\n    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\n    And \\'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\n    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\n    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;\\n    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,\\n    Who had but newly entertain\\'d revenge,\\n    And to\\'t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\n    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;\\n    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\\n    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\n\\n  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;\\n    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\n    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\n    And all those twenty could but kill one life.\\n    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.\\n    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.\\n\\n  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.\\n    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\n\\n  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio\\'s friend;\\n    His fault concludes but what the law should end,\\n    The life of Tybalt.\\n\\n  Prince. And for that offence\\n    Immediately we do exile him hence.\\n    I have an interest in your hate\\'s proceeding,\\n    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;\\n    But I\\'ll amerce you with so strong a fine\\n    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.\\n    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\\n    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\\n    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\\n    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.\\n    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.\\n    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene II.\\nCapulet\\'s orchard.\\n\\nEnter Juliet alone.\\n\\n\\n  Jul.

Come, civil night,\\n    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,\\n    And learn me how to lose a winning match,\\n    Play\\'d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\\n    Hood my unmann\\'d blood, bating in my cheeks,\\n    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,\\n    Think true love acted simple modesty.\\n    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;\\n    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\\n    Whiter than new snow upon a raven\\'s back.\\n    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow\\'d night;\\n    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,\\n    Take him and cut him out in little stars,\\n    And he will make the face of heaven so fine\\n    That all the world will be in love with night\\n    And pay no worship to the garish sun.\\n    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,\\n    But not possess\\'d it; and though I am sold,\\n    Not yet enjoy\\'d.

O, find him! give this ring to my true knight\\n    And bid him come to take his last farewell.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene III.\\nFriar Laurence\\'s cell.\\n\\nEnter Friar [Laurence].\\n\\n\\n  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.\\n    Affliction is enanmour\\'d of thy parts,\\n    And thou art wedded to calamity.\\n\\n                         Enter Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince\\'s doom\\n    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand\\n    That I yet know not?\\n\\n  Friar. Too familiar\\n    Is my dear son with such sour company.\\n    I bring thee tidings of the Prince\\'s doom.\\n\\n  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince\\'s doom?\\n\\n  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish\\'d from his lips-\\n    Not body\\'s death, but body\\'s banishment.\\n\\n  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say \\'death\\';\\n    For exile hath more terror in his look,\\n    Much more than death. Do not say \\'banishment.\\'\\n\\n  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.\\n    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.\\n\\n  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,\\n    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.\\n    Hence banished is banish\\'d from the world,\\n    And world\\'s exile is death. Then \\'banishment\\'\\n    Is death misterm\\'d. Calling death \\'banishment,\\'\\n    Thou cut\\'st my head off with a golden axe\\n    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\\n\\n  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!\\n    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,\\n    Taking thy part, hath rush\\'d aside the law,\\n    And turn\\'d that black word death to banishment.\\n    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\\n\\n  Rom. \\'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,\\n    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog\\n    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\n    Live here in heaven and may look on her;\\n    But Romeo may not. More validity,\\n    More honourable state, more courtship lives\\n    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\\n    On the white wonder of dear Juliet\\'s hand\\n    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,\\n    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,\\n    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;\\n    But Romeo may not- he is banished.\\n    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;\\n    They are free men, but I am banished.\\n    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?\\n    Hadst thou no poison mix\\'d, no sharp-ground knife,\\n    No sudden mean of death, though ne\\'er so mean,\\n    But \\'banished\\' to kill me- \\'banished\\'?\\n    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;\\n    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,\\n    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\n    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess\\'d,\\n    To mangle me with that word \\'banished\\'?\\n\\n  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\\n\\n  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\n\\n  Friar. I\\'ll give thee armour to keep off that word;\\n    Adversity\\'s sweet milk, philosophy,\\n    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\n\\n  Rom. Yet \\'banished\\'? Hang up philosophy!\\n    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,\\n    Displant a town, reverse a prince\\'s doom,\\n    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\\n\\n  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.\\n\\n  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\\n\\n  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.\\n\\n  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\\n    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\\n    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\\n    Doting like me, and like me banished,\\n    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\\n    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,\\n    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.\\n                                                 Knock [within].\\n\\n  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\\n\\n  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,\\n    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.\\n\\n  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who\\'s there? Romeo, arise;\\n    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.\\n    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God\\'s will,\\n    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.\\n    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What\\'s your will\\n\\n  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\\n    I come from Lady Juliet.\\n\\n  Friar. Welcome then.\\n\\n                       Enter Nurse.\\n\\n\\n  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar\\n    Where is my lady\\'s lord, where\\'s Romeo?\\n\\n  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.\\n\\n  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress\\' case,\\n    Just in her case!\\n\\n  Friar. O woeful sympathy!\\n    Piteous predicament!\\n\\n  Nurse. Even so lies she,\\n    Blubb\\'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\\n    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.\\n    For Juliet\\'s sake, for her sake, rise and stand!\\n    Why should you fall into so deep an O?\\n\\n  Rom. (rises) Nurse-\\n\\n  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death\\'s the end of all.\\n\\n  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\\n    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,\\n    Now I have stain\\'d the childhood of our joy\\n    With blood remov\\'d but little from her own?\\n    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says\\n    My conceal\\'d lady to our cancell\\'d love?\\n\\n  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\\n    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\\n    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\\n    And then down falls again.\\n\\n  Rom. As if that name,\\n    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,\\n    Did murther her; as that name\\'s cursed hand\\n    Murder\\'d her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,\\n    In what vile part of this anatomy\\n    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\\n    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]\\n\\n  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.\\n    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;\\n    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\\n    The unreasonable fury of a beast.\\n    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!\\n    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\\n    Thou hast amaz\\'d me. By my holy order,\\n    I thought thy disposition better temper\\'d.\\n    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\\n    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,\\n    By doing damned hate upon thyself?\\n    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?\\n    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet\\n    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\\n    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\\n    Which, like a usurer, abound\\'st in all,\\n    And usest none in that true use indeed\\n    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\\n    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax\\n    Digressing from the valour of a man;\\n    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\\n    Killing that love which thou hast vow\\'d to cherish;\\n    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\\n    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,\\n    Like powder in a skilless soldier\\'s flask,\\n    is get afire by thine own ignorance,\\n    And thou dismemb\\'red with thine own defence.\\n    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,\\n    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\\n    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\\n    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.\\n    The law, that threat\\'ned death, becomes thy friend\\n    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.\\n    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;\\n    Happiness courts thee in her best array;\\n    But, like a misbhav\\'d and sullen wench,\\n    Thou pout\\'st upon thy fortune and thy love.\\n    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\\n    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,\\n    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\\n    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,\\n    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,\\n    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time\\n    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\\n    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\\n    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy\\n    Than thou went\\'st forth in lamentation.\\n    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\\n    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,\\n    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\\n    Romeo is coming.\\n\\n  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay\\'d here all the night\\n    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\\n    My lord, I\\'ll tell my lady you will come.\\n\\n  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\\n\\n  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.\\n    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.\\n\\n  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv\\'d by this!\\n\\n  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:\\n    Either be gone before the watch be set,\\n    Or by the break of day disguis\\'d from hence.\\n    Sojourn in Mantua. I\\'ll find out your man,\\n    And he shall signify from time to time\\n    Every good hap to you that chances here.\\n    Give me thy hand. \\'Tis late. Farewell; good night.\\n\\n  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,\\n    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.\\n    Farewell.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene IV.\\nCapulet\\'s house\\n\\nEnter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.\\n\\n\\n  Cap. Things have fall\\'n out, sir, so unluckily\\n    That we have had no time to move our daughter.\\n    Look you, she lov\\'d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\\n    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.\\n    \\'Tis very late; she\\'ll not come down to-night.\\n    I promise you, but for your company,\\n    I would have been abed an hour ago.\\n\\n  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.\\n    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.\\n\\n  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;\\n    To-night she\\'s mew\\'d up to her heaviness.\\n\\n  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\\n    Of my child\\'s love. I think she will be rul\\'d\\n    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\\n    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;\\n    Acquaint her here of my son Paris\\' love\\n    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-\\n    But, soft! what day is this?\\n\\n  Par. Monday, my lord.\\n\\n  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.\\n    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her\\n    She shall be married to this noble earl.\\n    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?\\n    We\\'ll keep no great ado- a friend or two;\\n    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\\n    It may be thought we held him carelessly,\\n    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.\\n    Therefore we\\'ll have some half a dozen friends,\\n    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\\n\\n  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.\\n\\n  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\\n    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;\\n    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\\n    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!\\n    Afore me, It is so very very late\\n    That we may call it early by-and-by.\\n    Good night.\\n                                                          Exeunt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene V.\\nCapulet\\'s orchard.\\n\\nEnter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.\\n\\n\\n  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\\n    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,\\n    That pierc\\'d the fearful hollow of thine ear.\\n    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\\n    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\\n\\n  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;\\n    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\\n    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.\\n    Night\\'s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\\n    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\\n    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.\\n\\n  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.\\n    It is some meteor that the sun exhales\\n    To be to thee this night a torchbearer\\n    And light thee on the way to Mantua.\\n    Therefore stay yet; thou need\\'st not to be gone.\\n\\n  Rom. Let me be ta\\'en, let me be put to death.\\n    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.\\n    I\\'ll say yon grey is not the morning\\'s eye,\\n    \\'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia\\'s brow;\\n    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\\n    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\\n    I have more care to stay than will to go.\\n    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.\\n    How is\\'t, my soul? Let\\'s talk; it is not day.\\n\\n  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!\\n    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,\\n    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\\n    Some say the lark makes sweet division;\\n    This doth not so, for she divideth us.\\n    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang\\'d eyes;\\n    O, now I would they had chang\\'d voices too,\\n    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\\n    Hunting thee hence with hunt\\'s-up to the day!\\n    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.\\n\\n  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!\\n\\n                          Enter Nurse.\\n\\n\\n  Nurse. Madam!\\n\\n  Jul. Nurse?\\n\\n  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.\\n    The day is broke; be wary, look about.\\n\\n  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.\\n                                                         [Exit.]\\n\\n  Rom. Farewell, farewell!

Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?\\n    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,\\n    For in a minute there are many days.\\n    O, by this count I shall be much in years\\n    Ere I again behold my Romeo!\\n\\n  Rom. Farewell!\\n    I will omit no opportunity\\n    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\\n\\n  Jul. O, think\\'st thou we shall ever meet again?\\n\\n  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve\\n    For sweet discourses in our time to come.\\n\\n  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!\\n    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,\\n    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\\n    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look\\'st pale.\\n\\n  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\\n    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!\\nExit.\\n\\n  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.\\n    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\\n    That is renown\\'d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,\\n    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long\\n    But send him back.\\n\\n  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?\\n\\n  Jul. Who is\\'t that calls? It is my lady mother.\\n    Is she not down so late, or up so early?\\n    What unaccustom\\'d cause procures her hither?\\n\\n                       Enter Mother.\\n\\n\\n  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?\\n\\n  Jul. Madam, I am not well.\\n\\n  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin\\'s death?\\n    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\\n    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\\n    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;\\n    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.\\n\\n  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\\n\\n  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\\n    Which you weep for.\\n\\n  Jul. Feeling so the loss,\\n    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\\n\\n  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep\\'st not so much for his death\\n    As that the villain lives which slaughter\\'d him.\\n\\n  Jul. What villain, madam?\\n\\n  Lady. That same villain Romeo.\\n\\n  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-\\n    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;\\n    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\\n\\n  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.\\n\\n  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.\\n    Would none but I might venge my cousin\\'s death!\\n\\n  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\\n    Then weep no more. I\\'ll send to one in Mantua,\\n    Where that same banish\\'d runagate doth live,\\n    Shall give him such an unaccustom\\'d dram\\n    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;\\n    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\\n\\n  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied\\n    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-\\n    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex\\'d.\\n    Madam, if you could find out but a man\\n    To bear a poison, I would temper it;\\n    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\\n    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\\n    To hear him nam\\'d and cannot come to him,\\n    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt\\n    Upon his body that hath slaughter\\'d him!\\n\\n  Lady. Find thou the means, and I\\'ll find such a man.\\n    But now I\\'ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\\n\\n  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.\\n    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?\\n\\n  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\\n    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\\n    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy\\n    That thou expects not nor I look\\'d not for.\\n\\n  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?\\n\\n  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn\\n    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\\n    The County Paris, at Saint Peter\\'s Church,\\n    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\\n\\n  Jul. Now by Saint Peter\\'s Church, and Peter too,\\n    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!\\n    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed\\n    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.\\n    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\\n    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\\n    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\\n    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!\\n\\n  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,\\n    And see how be will take it at your hands.\\n\\n                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.\\n\\n\\n  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,\\n    But for the sunset of my brother\\'s son\\n    It rains downright.\\n    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\\n    Evermore show\\'ring? In one little body\\n    Thou counterfeit\\'st a bark, a sea, a wind:\\n    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\\n    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is\\n    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,\\n    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,\\n    Without a sudden calm will overset\\n    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\\n    Have you delivered to her our decree?\\n\\n  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\\n    I would the fool were married to her grave!\\n\\n  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.\\n    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\\n    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\\n    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought\\n    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\\n\\n  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.\\n    Proud can I never be of what I hate,\\n    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.\\n\\n  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?\\n    \\'Proud\\'- and \\'I thank you\\'- and \\'I thank you not\\'-\\n    And yet \\'not proud\\'? Mistress minion you,\\n    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\\n    But fettle your fine joints \\'gainst Thursday next\\n    To go with Paris to Saint Peter\\'s Church,\\n    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\\n    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!\\n    You tallow-face!\\n\\n  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?\\n\\n  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,\\n    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.\\n\\n  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!\\n    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday\\n    Or never after look me in the face.\\n    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!\\n    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\\n    That God had lent us but this only child;\\n    But now I see this one is one too much,\\n    And that we have a curse in having her.\\n    Out on her, hilding!\\n\\n  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!\\n    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\\n\\n  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,\\n    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!\\n\\n  Nurse. I speak no treason.\\n\\n  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!\\n\\n  Nurse. May not one speak?\\n\\n  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!\\n    Utter your gravity o\\'er a gossip\\'s bowl,\\n    For here we need it not.\\n\\n  Lady. You are too hot.\\n\\n  Cap. God\\'s bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,\\n    At home, abroad, alone, in company,\\n    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been\\n    To have her match\\'d; and having now provided\\n    A gentleman of princely parentage,\\n    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train\\'d,\\n    Stuff\\'d, as they say, with honourable parts,\\n    Proportion\\'d as one\\'s thought would wish a man-\\n    And then to have a wretched puling fool,\\n    A whining mammet, in her fortune\\'s tender,\\n    To answer \\'I\\'ll not wed, I cannot love;\\n    I am too young, I pray you pardon me\\'!\\n    But, an you will not wed, I\\'ll pardon you.\\n    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.\\n    Look to\\'t, think on\\'t; I do not use to jest.\\n    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:\\n    An you be mine, I\\'ll give you to my friend;\\n    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\\n    For, by my soul, I\\'ll ne\\'er acknowledge thee,\\n    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.\\n    Trust to\\'t. Bethink you. I\\'ll not be forsworn.         Exit.\\n\\n  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds\\n    That sees into the bottom of my grief?\\n    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!\\n    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;\\n    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed\\n    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\\n\\n  Lady.

My father Capulet will have it so,\\n    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\\n\\n  Friar. You say you do not know the lady\\'s mind.\\n    Uneven is the course; I like it not.\\n\\n  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt\\'s death,\\n    And therefore have I little talk\\'d of love;\\n    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\\n    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous\\n    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,\\n    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage\\n    To stop the inundation of her tears,\\n    Which, too much minded by herself alone,\\n    May be put from her by society.\\n    Now do you know the reason of this haste.\\n\\n  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow\\'d.-\\n    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\\n\\n                    Enter Juliet.\\n\\n\\n  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!\\n\\n  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\\n\\n  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\\n\\n  Jul. What must be shall be.\\n\\n  Friar. That\\'s a certain text.\\n\\n  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?\\n\\n  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.\\n\\n  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.\\n\\n  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.\\n\\n  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\\n\\n  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,\\n    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.\\n\\n  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus\\'d with tears.\\n\\n  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,\\n    For it was bad enough before their spite.\\n\\n  Par. Thou wrong\\'st it more than tears with that report.\\n\\n  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\\n    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.\\n\\n  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland\\'red it.\\n\\n  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.\\n    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,\\n    Or shall I come to you at evening mass\\n\\n  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\\n    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.\\n\\n  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!\\n    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.\\n    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.\\n\\n  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\\n    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!\\n\\n  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\\n    It strains me past the compass of my wits.\\n    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\\n    On Thursday next be married to this County.\\n\\n  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear\\'st of this,\\n    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\\n    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\\n    Do thou but call my resolution wise\\n    And with this knife I\\'ll help it presently.\\n    God join\\'d my heart and Romeo\\'s, thou our hands;\\n    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo\\'s seal\\'d,\\n    Shall be the label to another deed,\\n    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt\\n    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.\\n    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc\\'d time,\\n    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,\\n    \\'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\\n    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that\\n    Which the commission of thy years and art\\n    Could to no issue of true honour bring.\\n    Be not so long to speak. I long to die\\n    If what thou speak\\'st speak not of remedy.\\n\\n  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\\n    Which craves as desperate an execution\\n    As that is desperate which we would prevent.\\n    If, rather than to marry County Paris\\n    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\\n    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake\\n    A thing like death to chide away this shame,\\n    That cop\\'st with death himself to scape from it;\\n    And, if thou dar\\'st, I\\'ll give thee remedy.\\n\\n  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\\n    From off the battlements of yonder tower,\\n    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\\n    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,\\n    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,\\n    O\\'ercover\\'d quite with dead men\\'s rattling bones,\\n    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\\n    Or bid me go into a new-made grave\\n    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-\\n    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-\\n    And I will do it without fear or doubt,\\n    To live an unstain\\'d wife to my sweet love.\\n\\n  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent\\n    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.\\n    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\\n    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\\n    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\\n    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;\\n    When presently through all thy veins shall run\\n    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\\n    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;\\n    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\\n    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\\n    To paly ashes, thy eyes\\' windows fall\\n    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;\\n    Each part, depriv\\'d of supple government,\\n    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\\n    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\\n    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,\\n    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\\n    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\\n    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\\n    Then, as the manner of our country is,\\n    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier\\n    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\\n    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\\n    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\\n    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;\\n    And hither shall he come; and he and I\\n    Will watch thy waking, and that very night\\n    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\\n    And this shall free thee from this present shame,\\n    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\\n    Abate thy valour in the acting it.\\n\\n  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\\n\\n  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous\\n    In this resolve. I\\'ll send a friar with speed\\n    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\\n\\n  Jul.

Marry, sir, \\'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own\\n    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not\\n    with me.\\n\\n  Cap. Go, begone.\\n                                                Exit Servingman.\\n    We shall be much unfurnish\\'d for this time.\\n    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?\\n\\n  Nurse.

Pardon, I beseech you!\\n    Henceforward I am ever rul\\'d by you.\\n\\n  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.\\n    I\\'ll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.\\n\\n  Jul.

If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep\\n    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.\\n    My bosom\\'s lord sits lightly in his throne,\\n    And all this day an unaccustom\\'d spirit\\n    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.\\n    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead\\n    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)\\n    And breath\\'d such life with kisses in my lips\\n    That I reviv\\'d and was an emperor.\\n    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess\\'d,\\n    When but love\\'s shadows are so rich in joy!\\n\\n                Enter Romeo\\'s Man Balthasar, booted.\\n\\n    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?\\n    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?\\n    How doth my lady? Is my father well?\\n    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,\\n    For nothing can be ill if she be well.\\n\\n  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.\\n    Her body sleeps in Capel\\'s monument,\\n    And her immortal part with angels lives.\\n    I saw her laid low in her kindred\\'s vault\\n    And presently took post to tell it you.\\n    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,\\n    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.\\n\\n  Rom. Is it e\\'en so? Then I defy you, stars!\\n    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper\\n    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.\\n\\n  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.\\n    Your looks are pale and wild and do import\\n    Some misadventure.\\n\\n  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv\\'d.\\n    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.\\n    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?\\n\\n  Man. No, my good lord.\\n\\n  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone\\n    And hire those horses. I\\'ll be with thee straight.\\n                                               Exit [Balthasar].\\n    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.\\n    Let\\'s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift\\n    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!\\n    I do remember an apothecary,\\n    And hereabouts \\'a dwells, which late I noted\\n    In tatt\\'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,\\n    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,\\n    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;\\n    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\\n    An alligator stuff\\'d, and other skins\\n    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\\n    A beggarly account of empty boxes,\\n    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\\n    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\\n    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.\\n    Noting this penury, to myself I said,\\n    \\'An if a man did need a poison now\\n    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,\\n    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\\'\\n    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,\\n    And this same needy man must sell it me.\\n    As I remember, this should be the house.\\n    Being holiday, the beggar\\'s shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!\\n\\n                        Enter Apothecary.\\n\\n\\n  Apoth. Who calls so loud?\\n\\n  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\\n    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\\n    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\\n    As will disperse itself through all the veins\\n    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,\\n    And that the trunk may be discharg\\'d of breath\\n    As violently as hasty powder fir\\'d\\n    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon\\'s womb.\\n\\n  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua\\'s law\\n    Is death to any he that utters them.\\n\\n  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness\\n    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\\n    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\\n    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:\\n    The world is not thy friend, nor the world\\'s law;\\n    The world affords no law to make thee rich;\\n    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.\\n\\n  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.\\n\\n  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.\\n\\n  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will\\n    And drink it off, and if you had the strength\\n    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\\n\\n  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men\\'s souls,\\n    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,\\n    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\\n    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\\n    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.\\n    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me\\n    To Juliet\\'s grave; for there must I use thee.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene II.\\nVerona.

This same should be the voice of Friar John.\\n    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\\n    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\\n\\n  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,\\n    One of our order, to associate me\\n    Here in this city visiting the sick,\\n    And finding him, the searchers of the town,\\n    Suspecting that we both were in a house\\n    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,\\n    Seal\\'d up the doors, and would not let us forth,\\n    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay\\'d.\\n\\n  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?\\n\\n  John. I could not send it- here it is again-\\n    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,\\n    So fearful were they of infection.\\n\\n  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\\n    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,\\n    Of dear import; and the neglecting it\\n    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,\\n    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight\\n    Unto my cell.\\n\\n  John. Brother, I\\'ll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.\\n\\n  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.\\n    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\\n    She will beshrew me much that Romeo\\n    Hath had no notice of these accidents;\\n    But I will write again to Mantua,\\n    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-\\n    Poor living corse, clos\\'d in a dead man\\'s tomb!

Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew\\n    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)\\n    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;\\n    Or, wanting that, with tears distill\\'d by moans.\\n    The obsequies that I for thee will keep\\n    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.\\n                                                    Whistle Boy.\\n    The boy gives warning something doth approach.\\n    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night\\n    To cross my obsequies and true love\\'s rite?\\n    What, with a torch?

Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\\n    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning\\n    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.\\n    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,\\n    Whate\\'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof\\n    And do not interrupt me in my course.\\n    Why I descend into this bed of death\\n    Is partly to behold my lady\\'s face,\\n    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\\n    A precious ring- a ring that I must use\\n    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\\n    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry\\n    In what I farther shall intend to do,\\n    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint\\n    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\n    The time and my intents are savage-wild,\\n    More fierce and more inexorable far\\n    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\n\\n  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\n\\n  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\\n    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.\\n\\n  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I\\'ll hide me hereabout.\\n    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]\\n\\n  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\\n    Gorg\\'d with the dearest morsel of the earth,\\n    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\\n    And in despite I\\'ll cram thee with more food.\\n                                           Romeo opens the tomb.\\n\\n  Par. This is that banish\\'d haughty Montague\\n    That murd\\'red my love\\'s cousin- with which grief\\n    It is supposed the fair creature died-\\n    And here is come to do some villanous shame\\n    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\\n    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!\\n    Can vengeance be pursu\\'d further than death?\\n    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\\n    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.\\n\\n  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\\n    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp\\'rate man.\\n    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\\n    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\\n    But not another sin upon my head\\n    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!\\n    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,\\n    For I come hither arm\\'d against myself.\\n    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say\\n    A madman\\'s mercy bid thee run away.\\n\\n  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration\\n    And apprehend thee for a felon here.\\n\\n  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\\n                                                     They fight.\\n\\n  Page. O Lord, they fight!

[Dies.]\\n\\n  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\\n    Mercutio\\'s kinsman, noble County Paris!\\n    What said my man when my betossed soul\\n    Did not attend him as we rode? I think\\n    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.\\n    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?\\n    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet\\n    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\\n    One writ with me in sour misfortune\\'s book!\\n    I\\'ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\n    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught\\'red youth,\\n    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\n    This vault a feasting presence full of light.\\n    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr\\'d.\\n                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]\\n    How oft when men are at the point of death\\n    Have they been merry! which their keepers call\\n    A lightning before death. O, how may I\\n    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\\n    Death, that hath suck\\'d the honey of thy breath,\\n    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\n    Thou art not conquer\\'d. Beauty\\'s ensign yet\\n    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\n    And death\\'s pale flag is not advanced there.\\n    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\n    O, what more favour can I do to thee\\n    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\n    To sunder his that was thine enemy?\\n    Forgive me, cousin.\\' Ah, dear Juliet,\\n    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\n    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,\\n    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\n    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?\\n    For fear of that I still will stay with thee\\n    And never from this palace of dim night\\n    Depart again. Here, here will I remain\\n    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\n    Will I set up my everlasting rest\\n    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\n    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\\n    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\\n    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\n    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!\\n    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!\\n    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\n    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\\n    Here\\'s to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!\\n    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.\\n\\n    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.\\n\\n\\n  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\\n    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who\\'s there?\\n\\n  Bal. Here\\'s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\\n\\n  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,\\n    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light\\n    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\\n    It burneth in the Capels\\' monument.\\n\\n  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there\\'s my master,\\n    One that you love.\\n\\n  Friar. Who is it?\\n\\n  Bal. Romeo.\\n\\n  Friar. How long hath he been there?\\n\\n  Bal. Full half an hour.\\n\\n  Friar. Go with me to the vault.\\n\\n  Bal. I dare not, sir.\\n    My master knows not but I am gone hence,\\n    And fearfully did menace me with death\\n    If I did stay to look on his intents.\\n\\n  Friar. Stay then; I\\'ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\\n    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\\n\\n  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,\\n    I dreamt my master and another fought,\\n    And that my master slew him.\\n\\n  Friar. Romeo!\\n    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains\\n    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?\\n    What mean these masterless and gory swords\\n    To lie discolour\\'d by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]\\n    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\\n    And steep\\'d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\\n    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.\\n                                                   Juliet rises.\\n\\n  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?\\n    I do remember well where I should be,\\n    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?\\n\\n  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\\n    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\\n    A greater power than we can contradict\\n    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\\n    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\\n    And Paris too. Come, I\\'ll dispose of thee\\n    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.\\n    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.\\n    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\\n\\n  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.\\n                                                   Exit [Friar].\\n    What\\'s here? A cup, clos\\'d in my true love\\'s hand?\\n    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\\n    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop\\n    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\\n    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them\\n    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]\\n    Thy lips are warm!\\n\\n  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?\\n    Yea, noise? Then I\\'ll be brief. O happy dagger!\\n                                      [Snatches Romeo\\'s dagger.]\\n    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.\\n                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo\\'s body].\\n\\n                Enter [Paris\\'s] Boy and Watch.\\n\\n\\n  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. \\'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.\\n    Go, some of you; whoe\\'er you find attach.\\n                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]\\n    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;\\n    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\\n    Who here hath lain this two days buried.\\n    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;\\n    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.\\n                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]\\n    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\\n    But the true ground of all these piteous woes\\n    We cannot without circumstance descry.\\n\\n     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo\\'s Man [Balthasar].\\n\\n  2. Watch. Here\\'s Romeo\\'s man. We found him in the churchyard.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\\n\\n          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.\\n\\n  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\\n    We took this mattock and this spade from him\\n    As he was coming from this churchyard side.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.\\n\\n              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].\\n\\n\\n  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,\\n    That calls our person from our morning rest?\\n\\n            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].\\n\\n\\n  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\\n\\n  Wife. The people in the street cry \\'Romeo,\\'\\n    Some \\'Juliet,\\' and some \\'Paris\\'; and all run,\\n    With open outcry, toward our monument.\\n\\n  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?\\n\\n  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;\\n    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,\\n    Warm and new kill\\'d.\\n\\n  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter\\'d Romeo\\'s man,\\n    With instruments upon them fit to open\\n    These dead men\\'s tombs.\\n\\n  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\\n    This dagger hath mista\\'en, for, lo, his house\\n    Is empty on the back of Montague,\\n    And it missheathed in my daughter\\'s bosom!\\n\\n  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell\\n    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.\\n\\n               Enter Montague [and others].\\n\\n\\n  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up\\n    To see thy son and heir more early down.\\n\\n  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!\\n    Grief of my son\\'s exile hath stopp\\'d her breath.\\n    What further woe conspires against mine age?\\n\\n  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.\\n\\n  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,\\n    To press before thy father to a grave?\\n\\n  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\\n    Till we can clear these ambiguities\\n    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;\\n    And then will I be general of your woes\\n    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\\n    And let mischance be slave to patience.\\n    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.\\n\\n  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,\\n    Yet most suspected, as the time and place\\n    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;\\n    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\n    Myself condemned and myself excus\\'d.\\n\\n  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.\\n\\n  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath\\n    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.\\n    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\\n    And she, there dead, that Romeo\\'s faithful wife.\\n    I married them; and their stol\\'n marriage day\\n    Was Tybalt\\'s doomsday, whose untimely death\\n    Banish\\'d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\n    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin\\'d.\\n    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\n    Betroth\\'d and would have married her perforce\\n    To County Paris. Then comes she to me\\n    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean\\n    To rid her from this second marriage,\\n    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.\\n    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)\\n    A sleeping potion; which so took effect\\n    As I intended, for it wrought on her\\n    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\n    That he should hither come as this dire night\\n    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,\\n    Being the time the potion\\'s force should cease.\\n    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\n    Was stay\\'d by accident, and yesternight\\n    Return\\'d my letter back. Then all alone\\n    At the prefixed hour of her waking\\n    Came I to take her from her kindred\\'s vault;\\n    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell\\n    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\n    But when I came, some minute ere the time\\n    Of her awaking, here untimely lay\\n    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\n    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\n    And bear this work of heaven with patience;\\n    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\\n    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\n    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\n    All this I know, and to the marriage\\n    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this\\n    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\\n    Be sacrific\\'d, some hour before his time,\\n    Unto the rigour of severest law.\\n\\n  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\\n    Where\\'s Romeo\\'s man? What can he say in this?\\n\\n  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet\\'s death;\\n    And then in post he came from Mantua\\n    To this same place, to this same monument.\\n    This letter he early bid me give his father,\\n    And threat\\'ned me with death, going in the vault,\\n    If I departed not and left him there.\\n\\n  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\\n    Where is the County\\'s page that rais\\'d the watch?\\n    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?\\n\\n  Boy.

Capulet, Montage,\\n    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\n    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\n    And I, for winking at you, discords too,\\n    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish\\'d.\\n\\n  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\n    This is my daughter\\'s jointure, for no more\\n    Can I demand.\\n\\n  Mon. But I can give thee more;\\n    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,\\n    That whiles Verona by that name is known,\\n    There shall no figure at such rate be set\\n    As that of true and faithful Juliet.\\n\\n  Cap. As rich shall Romeo\\'s by his lady\\'s lie-\\n    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!\\n\\n  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\\n    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\n    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\\n    Some shall be pardon\\'d, and some punished;\\n    For never was a story of more woe\\n    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\n                                                   Exeunt omnes.'"

Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.\\n\\n  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.\\n\\n  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.\\n\\n  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.\\n\\n  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.\\n\\n  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\\n\\n  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\\n\\n  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\\n    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\\n\\n  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\\n    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\\n\\n  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\\n    wall.\\n\\n  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\\n    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men\\n    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\\n\\n  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\\n\\n  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have\\n    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off\\n    their heads.\\n\\n  Greg. The heads of the maids?\\n\\n  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\\n    Take it in what sense thou wilt.\\n\\n  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.\\n\\n  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I\\n    am a pretty piece of flesh.\\n\\n  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst\\n    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of\\n    Montagues.\\n\\n           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].\\n\\n\\n  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.\\n\\n  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?\\n\\n  Samp. Fear me not.\\n\\n  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!\\n\\n  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\\n\\n  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\\n\\n  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is\\n    disgrace to them, if they bear it.\\n\\n  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\n  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\n  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\n  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?\\n\\n  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.\\n\\n  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my\\n    thumb, sir.\\n\\n  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?\\n\\n  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\\n\\n  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as\\n    you.\\n\\n  Abr. No better.\\n\\n  Samp. Well, sir.\\n\\n                        Enter Benvolio.\\n\\n\\n  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my\\n    master's kinsmen.\\n\\n  Samp. Yes, better, sir.\\n\\n  Abr. You lie.\\n\\n  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.\\n                                                     They fight.\\n\\n  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]\\n    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.\\n\\n                          Enter Tybalt.\\n\\n\\n  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\\n    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.\\n\\n  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,\\n    Or manage it to part these men with me.\\n\\n  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\\n    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.\\n    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.\\n\\n     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or\\n                          partisans.\\n\\n\\n  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!\\n\\n  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\\n\\n           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.\\n\\n\\n  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\\n\\n  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\\n\\n  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come\\n    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.\\n\\n                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.\\n\\n\\n  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.\\n\\n  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\\n\\n                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.\\n\\n\\n  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\\n    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-\\n    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\\n    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\n    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!\\n    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\n    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground\\n    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\n    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word\\n    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\n    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets\\n    And made Verona's ancient citizens\\n    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments\\n    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\n    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.\\n    If ever you disturb our streets again,\\n    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\n    For this time all the rest depart away.\\n    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;\\n    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,\\n    To know our farther pleasure in this case,\\n    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.\\n    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\n              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].\\n\\n  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\n    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\n\\n  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary\\n    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\n    I drew to part them. In the instant came\\n    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;\\n    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,\\n    He swung about his head and cut the winds,\\n    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.\\n    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\\n    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\\n    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.\\n\\n  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?\\n    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\\n\\n  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun\\n    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,\\n    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\\n    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore\\n    That westward rooteth from the city's side,\\n    So early walking did I see your son.\\n    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me\\n    And stole into the covert of the wood.\\n    I- measuring his affections by my own,\\n    Which then most sought where most might not be found,\\n    Being one too many by my weary self-\\n    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,\\n    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.\\n\\n  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,\\n    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,\\n    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\n    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\n    Should in the furthest East bean to draw\\n    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\\n    Away from light steals home my heavy son\\n    And private in his chamber pens himself,\\n    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight\\n    And makes himself an artificial night.\\n    Black and portentous must this humour prove\\n    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\n\\n  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\n  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him\\n\\n  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?\\n\\n  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;\\n    But he, his own affections' counsellor,\\n    Is to himself- I will not say how true-\\n    But to himself so secret and so close,\\n    So far from sounding and discovery,\\n    As is the bud bit with an envious worm\\n    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\\n    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\n    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\n    We would as willingly give cure as know.\\n\\n                       Enter Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,\\n    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.\\n\\n  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\n    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,\\n                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].\\n\\n  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.\\n\\n  Rom. Is the day so young?\\n\\n  Ben. But new struck nine.\\n\\n  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.\\n    Was that my father that went hence so fast?\\n\\n  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\\n\\n  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.\\n\\n  Ben. In love?\\n\\n  Rom. Out-\\n\\n  Ben. Of love?\\n\\n  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.\\n\\n  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,\\n    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\\n\\n  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\n    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!\\n    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\\n    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\n    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.\\n    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\n    O anything, of nothing first create!\\n    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\n    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\n    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\n    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is\\n    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\n    Dost thou not laugh?\\n\\n  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.\\n\\n  Rom. Good heart, at what?\\n\\n  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.\\n\\n  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.\\n    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\n    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\\n    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\n    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\n    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;\\n    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\\n    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.\\n    What is it else? A madness most discreet,\\n    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\n    Farewell, my coz.\\n\\n  Ben. Soft! I will go along.\\n    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\n\\n  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:\\n    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.\\n\\n  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?\\n\\n  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?\\n\\n  Ben. Groan? Why, no;\\n    But sadly tell me who.\\n\\n  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.\\n    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!\\n    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\n\\n  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.\\n\\n  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.\\n\\n  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\n\\n  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit\\n    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,\\n    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,\\n    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.\\n    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,\\n    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,\\n    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\\n    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor\\n    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\n\\n  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\n\\n  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\n    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,\\n    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\\n    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\\n    To merit bliss by making me despair.\\n    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\\n    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\\n\\n  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.\\n\\n  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\\n\\n  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.\\n    Examine other beauties.\\n\\n  Rom. 'Tis the way\\n    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.\\n    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,\\n    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.\\n    He that is strucken blind cannot forget\\n    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\\n    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\\n    What doth her beauty serve but as a note\\n    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?\\n    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\\n\\n  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene II.\\nA Street.\\n\\nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.\\n\\n\\n  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,\\n    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,\\n    For men so old as we to keep the peace.\\n\\n  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,\\n    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.\\n    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\\n\\n  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:\\n    My child is yet a stranger in the world,\\n    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\\n    Let two more summers wither in their pride\\n    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\\n\\n  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.\\n\\n  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.\\n    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\\n    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.\\n    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\\n    My will to her consent is but a part.\\n    An she agree, within her scope of choice\\n    Lies my consent and fair according voice.\\n    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,\\n    Whereto I have invited many a guest,\\n    Such as I love; and you among the store,\\n    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\\n    At my poor house look to behold this night\\n    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\\n    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel\\n    When well apparell'd April on the heel\\n    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight\\n    Among fresh female buds shall you this night\\n    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\\n    And like her most whose merit most shall be;\\n    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,\\n    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.\\n    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,\\n    sirrah, trudge about\\n    Through fair Verona; find those persons out\\n    Whose names are written there, and to them say,\\n    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-\\n                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].\\n\\n  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written\\n    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor\\n    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter\\n    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are\\n    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person\\n    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!\\n\\n                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;\\n    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;\\n    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\\n    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.\\n    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\\n    And the rank poison of the old will die.\\n\\n  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.\\n\\n  Ben. For what, I pray thee?\\n\\n  Rom. For your broken shin.\\n\\n  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?\\n\\n  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;\\n    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,\\n    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.\\n\\n  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\\n\\n  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.\\n\\n  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can\\n    you read anything you see?\\n\\n  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.\\n\\n  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!\\n\\n  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.\\n\\n      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\\n      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\\n      The lady widow of Vitruvio;\\n      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;\\n      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;\\n      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\\n      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\\n      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;\\n      Lucio and the lively Helena.'\\n\\n    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they\\n    come?\\n\\n  Serv. Up.\\n\\n  Rom. Whither?\\n\\n  Serv. To supper, to our house.\\n\\n  Rom. Whose house?\\n\\n  Serv. My master's.\\n\\n  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.\\n\\n  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great\\n    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray\\n    come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.\\n\\n  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's\\n    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;\\n    With all the admired beauties of Verona.\\n    Go thither, and with unattainted eye\\n    Compare her face with some that I shall show,\\n    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\\n\\n  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye\\n    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;\\n    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,\\n    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!\\n    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\\n    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.\\n\\n  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,\\n    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;\\n    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd\\n    Your lady's love against some other maid\\n    That I will show you shining at this feast,\\n    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.\\n\\n  Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,\\n    But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene III.\\nCapulet's house.\\n\\nEnter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.\\n\\n\\n  Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.\\n\\n  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\\n    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!\\n    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!\\n\\n                         Enter Juliet.\\n\\n\\n  Jul. How now? Who calls?\\n\\n  Nurse. Your mother.\\n\\n  Jul. Madam, I am here.\\n    What is your will?\\n\\n  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,\\n    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;\\n    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.\\n    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\\n\\n  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\\n\\n  Wife. She's not fourteen.\\n\\n  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-\\n    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\\n    She is not fourteen. How long is it now\\n    To Lammastide?\\n\\n  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.\\n\\n  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\\n    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\\n    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\\n    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\\n    She was too good for me. But, as I said,\\n    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\\n    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\\n    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\\n    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),\\n    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;\\n    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\\n    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\\n    My lord and you were then at Mantua.\\n    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\\n    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\\n    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\\n    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\\n    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,\\n    To bid me trudge.\\n    And since that time it is eleven years,\\n    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,\\n    She could have run and waddled all about;\\n    For even the day before, she broke her brow;\\n    And then my husband (God be with his soul!\\n    'A was a merry man) took up the child.\\n    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,\\n    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'\\n    To see now how a jest shall come about!\\n    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\\n    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,\\n    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'\\n\\n  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\\n\\n  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\\n    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'\\n    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow\\n    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;\\n    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\\n    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?\\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'\\n\\n  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\\n\\n  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\\n    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.\\n    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\\n\\n  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme\\n    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\\n    How stands your disposition to be married?\\n\\n  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\\n\\n  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\\n    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.\\n\\n  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\\n    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\\n    Are made already mothers. By my count,\\n    I was your mother much upon these years\\n    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\\n    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\\n\\n  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\\n    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.\\n\\n  Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.\\n\\n  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.\\n\\n  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\\n    This night you shall behold him at our feast.\\n    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,\\n    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;\\n    Examine every married lineament,\\n    And see how one another lends content;\\n    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies\\n    Find written in the margent of his eyes,\\n    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,\\n    To beautify him only lacks a cover.\\n    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride\\n    For fair without the fair within to hide.\\n    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,\\n    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\\n    So shall you share all that he doth possess,\\n    By having him making yourself no less.\\n\\n  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men\\n\\n  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?\\n\\n  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;\\n    But no more deep will I endart mine eye\\n    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\\n\\n                        Enter Servingman.\\n\\n\\n  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,\\n    my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and\\n    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait.

What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\\n    Or shall we on without apology?\\n\\n  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.\\n    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,\\n    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,\\n    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;\\n    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\\n    After the prompter, for our entrance;\\n    But, let them measure us by what they will,\\n    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.\\n\\n  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\\n    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.\\n\\n  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\\n\\n  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\\n    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\\n    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\\n\\n  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings\\n    And soar with them above a common bound.\\n\\n  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\\n    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound\\n    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\\n    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.\\n\\n  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-\\n    Too great oppression for a tender thing.\\n\\n  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,\\n    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\\n\\n  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.\\n    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\\n    Give me a case to put my visage in.\\n    A visor for a visor! What care I\\n    What curious eye doth quote deformities?\\n    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\\n\\n  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in\\n    But every man betake him to his legs.\\n\\n  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart\\n    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\\n    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,\\n    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;\\n    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.\\n\\n  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!\\n    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire\\n    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st\\n    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\\n\\n  Rom. Nay, that's not so.\\n\\n  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay\\n    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\\n    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\\n    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.\\n\\n  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;\\n    But 'tis no wit to go.\\n\\n  Mer. Why, may one ask?\\n\\n  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.\\n\\n  Mer. And so did I.\\n\\n  Rom. Well, what was yours?\\n\\n  Mer. That dreamers often lie.\\n\\n  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\\n\\n  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\\n    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\\n    In shape no bigger than an agate stone\\n    On the forefinger of an alderman,\\n    Drawn with a team of little atomies\\n    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\\n    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,\\n    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\\n    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;\\n    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;\\n    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;\\n    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\\n    Not half so big as a round little worm\\n    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\\n    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\\n    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\\n    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\\n    And in this state she 'gallops night by night\\n    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\\n    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\\n    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\\n    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\\n    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\\n    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\\n    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\\n    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\\n    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\\n    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,\\n    Then dreams he of another benefice.\\n    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\\n    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\\n    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\\n    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon\\n    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\\n    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\\n    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\\n    That plats the manes of horses in the night\\n    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\\n    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes\\n    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\\n    That presses them and learns them first to bear,\\n    Making them women of good carriage.\\n    This is she-\\n\\n  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\\n    Thou talk'st of nothing.\\n\\n  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;\\n    Which are the children of an idle brain,\\n    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;\\n    Which is as thin of substance as the air,\\n    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\\n    Even now the frozen bosom of the North\\n    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,\\n    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.\\n\\n  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\\n    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\\n\\n  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\\n    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\\n    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\\n    With this night's revels and expire the term\\n    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,\\n    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.\\n    But he that hath the steerage of my course\\n    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!\\n\\n  Ben. Strike, drum.\\n                           They march about the stage.

O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\\n    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\\n    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-\\n    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\\n    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\\n    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.\\n    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand\\n    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\\n    Did my heart love till now?

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\\n    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\\n    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\\n    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\\n\\n  Rom.

O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!\\n    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\\n\\n  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\\n\\n  Rom.

O gentle Romeo,\\n    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\\n    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\\n    I\\'ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\\n    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\\n    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\\n    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\\n    But trust me, gentleman, I\\'ll prove more true\\n    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\\n    I should have been more strange, I must confess,\\n    But that thou overheard\\'st, ere I was ware,\\n    My true-love passion.

Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\\n    I have no joy of this contract to-night.\\n    It is too rash, too unadvis\\'d, too sudden;\\n    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be\\n    Ere one can say \\'It lightens.\\' Sweet, good night!\\n    This bud of love, by summer\\'s ripening breath,\\n    May prove a beauteous flow\\'r when next we meet.\\n    Good night, good night!

I would have thee gone-\\n    And yet no farther than a wanton\\'s bird,\\n    That lets it hop a little from her hand,\\n    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\\n    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\\n    So loving-jealous of his liberty.\\n\\n  Rom. I would I were thy bird.\\n\\n  Jul. Sweet, so would I.\\n    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\\n    Good night, good night!

Good morrow, father.\\n\\n  Friar.

Where the devil should this Romeo be?\\n    Came he not home to-night?\\n\\n  Ben. Not to his father\\'s. I spoke with his man.\\n\\n  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,\\n    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.\\n\\n  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,\\n    Hath sent a letter to his father\\'s house.\\n\\n  Mer. A challenge, on my life.\\n\\n  Ben. Romeo will answer it.\\n\\n  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.\\n\\n  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter\\'s master, how he dares,\\n    being dared.\\n\\n  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb\\'d with a white\\n    wench\\'s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the\\n    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy\\'s\\n    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?\\n\\n  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?\\n\\n  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he\\'s the\\n    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing\\n    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his\\n    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very\\n    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman\\n    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the\\n    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.\\n\\n  Ben. The what?\\n\\n  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-\\n    these new tuners of accent! \\'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very\\n    tall man! a very good whore!\\' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,\\n    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange\\n    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi\\'s, who stand\\n    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old\\n    bench? O, their bones, their bones!\\n\\n                               Enter Romeo.\\n\\n\\n  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!\\n\\n  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how\\n    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch\\n    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she\\n    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,\\n    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,\\n    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There\\'s a French\\n    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit\\n    fairly last night.\\n\\n  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\\n\\n  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\\n\\n  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a\\n    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.\\n\\n  Mer. That\\'s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a\\n    man to bow in the hams.\\n\\n  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.\\n\\n  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.\\n\\n  Rom. A most courteous exposition.\\n\\n  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\\n\\n  Rom. Pink for flower.\\n\\n  Mer. Right.\\n\\n  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower\\'d.\\n\\n  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out\\n    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may\\n    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.\\n\\n  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!\\n\\n  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.\\n\\n  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I\\'ll cry a match.\\n\\n  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for\\n    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am\\n    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\n\\n  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not\\n    there for the goose.\\n\\n  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\\n\\n  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!\\n\\n  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.\\n\\n  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv\\'d in to a sweet goose?\\n\\n  Mer. O, here\\'s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch\\n    narrow to an ell broad!\\n\\n  Rom. I stretch it out for that word \\'broad,\\' which, added to\\n    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\\n\\n  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now\\n    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by\\n    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a\\n    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in\\n    a hole.\\n\\n  Ben. Stop there, stop there!\\n\\n  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\n\\n  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\n\\n  Mer. O, thou art deceiv\\'d! I would have made it short; for I\\n    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to\\n    occupy the argument no longer.\\n\\n  Rom. Here\\'s goodly gear!\\n\\n                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].\\n\\n\\n  Mer. A sail, a sail!\\n\\n  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.\\n\\n  Nurse. Peter!\\n\\n  Peter.

God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\n\\n  Nurse. Is it good-den?\\n\\n  Mer. \\'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is\\n    now upon the prick of noon.\\n\\n  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!\\n\\n  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\n\\n  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. \\'For himself to mar,\\'\\n    quoth \\'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the\\n    young Romeo?\\n\\n  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you\\n    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest\\n    of that name, for fault of a worse.\\n\\n  Nurse. You say well.\\n\\n  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i\\' faith! wisely,\\n    wisely.\\n\\n  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\n\\n  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.\\n\\n  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\n\\n  Rom. What hast thou found?\\n\\n  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is\\n    something stale and hoar ere it be spent\\n                                     He walks by them and sings.\\n\\n                   An old hare hoar,\\n                   And an old hare hoar,\\n                Is very good meat in Lent;\\n                   But a hare that is hoar\\n                   Is too much for a score\\n                When it hoars ere it be spent.\\n\\n    Romeo, will you come to your father\\'s? We\\'ll to dinner thither.\\n\\n  Rom. I will follow you.\\n\\n  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady.

I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant\\n    was this that was so full of his ropery?\\n\\n  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and\\n    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\n\\n  Nurse. An \\'a speak anything against me, I\\'ll take him down, an\\n\\'a\\n    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,\\n    I\\'ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\\n    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\\n    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\\n\\n  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my\\n    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as\\n    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the\\n    law on my side.\\n\\n  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me\\n    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,\\n    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I\\n    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead\\n    her into a fool\\'s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of\\n    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and\\n    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\\n    an ill thing to be off\\'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.\\n\\n  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\n    thee-\\n\\n  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\\n    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.\\n\\n  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\n\\n  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\\n    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\\n\\n  Rom. Bid her devise\\n    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;\\n    And there she shall at Friar Laurence\\' cell\\n    Be shriv\\'d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\n\\n  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\\n\\n  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.\\n\\n  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\n\\n  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\n    Within this hour my man shall be with thee\\n    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\n    Which to the high topgallant of my joy\\n    Must be my convoy in the secret night.\\n    Farewell. Be trusty, and I\\'ll quit thy pains.\\n    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\\n\\n  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\\n\\n  Rom. What say\\'st thou, my dear nurse?\\n\\n  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne\\'er hear say,\\n    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?\\n\\n  Rom. I warrant thee my man\\'s as true as steel.\\n\\n  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!\\n    when \\'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in\\n    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,\\n    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I\\n    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;\\n    but I\\'ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\\n    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both\\n    with a letter?\\n\\n  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\n\\n  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that\\'s the dog\\'s name. R is for the- No; I\\n    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest\\n    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you\\n    good to hear it.\\n\\n  Rom.

I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.\\n    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.\\n    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\\n    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\\n\\n  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters\\n    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and\\n    says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the\\n    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.\\n\\n  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?\\n\\n  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in\\n    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be\\n    moved.\\n\\n  Ben. And what to?\\n\\n  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,\\n    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a\\n    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.\\n    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no\\n    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an\\n    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels\\n    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as\\n    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a\\n    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog\\n    that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a\\n    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with\\n    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\n    tutor me from quarrelling!\\n\\n  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should\\n    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\n\\n  Mer.

We talk here in the public haunt of men.\\n    Either withdraw unto some private place\\n    And reason coldly of your grievances,\\n    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.\\n\\n  Mer.

Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\n    No better term than this: thou art a villain.\\n\\n  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\n    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage\\n    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.\\n    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.\\n\\n  Tyb.

All this- uttered\\n    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-\\n    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\\n    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\n    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;\\n    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\n    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\n    Cold death aside and with the other sends\\n    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\n    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\n    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,\\n    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\n    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\n    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\n    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;\\n    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,\\n    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,\\n    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I\\n    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;\\n    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\\n    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\n\\n  Cap.

Too familiar\\n    Is my dear son with such sour company.\\n    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.\\n\\n  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?\\n\\n  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-\\n    Not body's death, but body's banishment.\\n\\n  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';\\n    For exile hath more terror in his look,\\n    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'\\n\\n  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.\\n    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.\\n\\n  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,\\n    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.\\n    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,\\n    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'\\n    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'\\n    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe\\n    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\\n\\n  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!\\n    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,\\n    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,\\n    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.\\n    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\\n\\n  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,\\n    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog\\n    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\\n    Live here in heaven and may look on her;\\n    But Romeo may not. More validity,\\n    More honourable state, more courtship lives\\n    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\\n    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand\\n    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,\\n    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,\\n    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;\\n    But Romeo may not- he is banished.\\n    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;\\n    They are free men, but I am banished.\\n    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?\\n    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,\\n    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,\\n    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?\\n    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;\\n    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,\\n    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,\\n    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,\\n    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?\\n\\n  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\\n\\n  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\\n\\n  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;\\n    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,\\n    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.\\n\\n  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!\\n    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,\\n    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,\\n    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\\n\\n  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.\\n\\n  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\\n\\n  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.\\n\\n  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\\n    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\\n    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\\n    Doting like me, and like me banished,\\n    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\\n    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,\\n    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.\\n                                                 Knock [within].\\n\\n  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\\n\\n  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,\\n    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.\\n\\n  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;\\n    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.\\n    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,\\n    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.\\n    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will\\n\\n  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\\n    I come from Lady Juliet.\\n\\n  Friar. Welcome then.\\n\\n                       Enter Nurse.\\n\\n\\n  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar\\n    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?\\n\\n  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.\\n\\n  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,\\n    Just in her case!\\n\\n  Friar. O woeful sympathy!\\n    Piteous predicament!\\n\\n  Nurse. Even so lies she,\\n    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\\n    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.\\n    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!\\n    Why should you fall into so deep an O?\\n\\n  Rom. (rises) Nurse-\\n\\n  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.\\n\\n  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\\n    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,\\n    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy\\n    With blood remov'd but little from her own?\\n    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says\\n    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?\\n\\n  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\\n    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\\n    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\\n    And then down falls again.\\n\\n  Rom. As if that name,\\n    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,\\n    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand\\n    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,\\n    In what vile part of this anatomy\\n    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\\n    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]\\n\\n  Friar.

Thy form cries out thou art;\\n    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\\n    The unreasonable fury of a beast.\\n    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!\\n    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\\n    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,\\n    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.\\n    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\\n    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,\\n    By doing damned hate upon thyself?\\n    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?\\n    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet\\n    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\\n    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\\n    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,\\n    And usest none in that true use indeed\\n    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\\n    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax\\n    Digressing from the valour of a man;\\n    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\\n    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;\\n    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\\n    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,\\n    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,\\n    is get afire by thine own ignorance,\\n    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.\\n    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,\\n    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\\n    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\\n    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.\\n    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend\\n    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.\\n    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;\\n    Happiness courts thee in her best array;\\n    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,\\n    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.\\n    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\\n    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,\\n    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\\n    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,\\n    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,\\n    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time\\n    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\\n    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\\n    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy\\n    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.\\n    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\\n    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,\\n    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\\n    Romeo is coming.\\n\\n  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night\\n    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\\n    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.\\n\\n  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\\n\\n  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.\\n    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.\\n\\n  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!\\n\\n  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:\\n    Either be gone before the watch be set,\\n    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.\\n    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,\\n    And he shall signify from time to time\\n    Every good hap to you that chances here.\\n    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.\\n\\n  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,\\n    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.\\n    Farewell.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene IV.\\nCapulet's house\\n\\nEnter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.\\n\\n\\n  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily\\n    That we have had no time to move our daughter.\\n    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\\n    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.\\n    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.\\n    I promise you, but for your company,\\n    I would have been abed an hour ago.\\n\\n  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.\\n    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.\\n\\n  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;\\n    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.\\n\\n  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\\n    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd\\n    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\\n    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;\\n    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love\\n    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-\\n    But, soft! what day is this?\\n\\n  Par. Monday, my lord.\\n\\n  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.\\n    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her\\n    She shall be married to this noble earl.\\n    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?\\n    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;\\n    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\\n    It may be thought we held him carelessly,\\n    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.\\n    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,\\n    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\\n\\n  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.\\n\\n  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\\n    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;\\n    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\\n    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!\\n    Afore me, It is so very very late\\n    That we may call it early by-and-by.\\n    Good night.\\n                                                          Exeunt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene V.\\nCapulet's orchard.\\n\\nEnter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.\\n\\n\\n  Jul.

It was the lark, the herald of the morn;\\n    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\\n    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.\\n    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day\\n    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\\n    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.\\n\\n  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.\\n    It is some meteor that the sun exhales\\n    To be to thee this night a torchbearer\\n    And light thee on the way to Mantua.\\n    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.\\n\\n  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.\\n    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.\\n    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,\\n    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;\\n    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\\n    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\\n    I have more care to stay than will to go.\\n    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.\\n    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.\\n\\n  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!\\n    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,\\n    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\\n    Some say the lark makes sweet division;\\n    This doth not so, for she divideth us.\\n    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;\\n    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,\\n    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\\n    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!\\n    O, now be gone!

I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve\\n    For sweet discourses in our time to come.\\n\\n  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!\\n    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,\\n    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\\n    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.\\n\\n  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\\n    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!\\nExit.\\n\\n  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.\\n    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\\n    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,\\n    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long\\n    But send him back.\\n\\n  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?\\n\\n  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.\\n    Is she not down so late, or up so early?\\n    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?\\n\\n                       Enter Mother.\\n\\n\\n  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?\\n\\n  Jul. Madam, I am not well.\\n\\n  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?\\n    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\\n    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\\n    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;\\n    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.\\n\\n  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\\n\\n  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\\n    Which you weep for.\\n\\n  Jul. Feeling so the loss,\\n    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\\n\\n  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death\\n    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.\\n\\n  Jul. What villain, madam?\\n\\n  Lady. That same villain Romeo.\\n\\n  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-\\n    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;\\n    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\\n\\n  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.\\n\\n  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.\\n    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!\\n\\n  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\\n    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,\\n    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,\\n    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram\\n    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;\\n    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\\n\\n  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied\\n    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-\\n    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.\\n    Madam, if you could find out but a man\\n    To bear a poison, I would temper it;\\n    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\\n    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\\n    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,\\n    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt\\n    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!\\n\\n  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.\\n    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\\n\\n  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.\\n    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?\\n\\n  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\\n    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\\n    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy\\n    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.\\n\\n  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?\\n\\n  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn\\n    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\\n    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,\\n    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\\n\\n  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,\\n    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!\\n    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed\\n    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.\\n    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\\n    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\\n    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\\n    Rather than Paris.

When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,\\n    But for the sunset of my brother's son\\n    It rains downright.\\n    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\\n    Evermore show'ring? In one little body\\n    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:\\n    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\\n    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is\\n    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,\\n    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,\\n    Without a sudden calm will overset\\n    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\\n    Have you delivered to her our decree?\\n\\n  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\\n    I would the fool were married to her grave!\\n\\n  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.\\n    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\\n    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\\n    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought\\n    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\\n\\n  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.\\n    Proud can I never be of what I hate,\\n    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.\\n\\n  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?\\n    'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-\\n    And yet 'not proud'?

My father Capulet will have it so,\\n    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\\n\\n  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.\\n    Uneven is the course; I like it not.\\n\\n  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,\\n    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;\\n    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\\n    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous\\n    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,\\n    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage\\n    To stop the inundation of her tears,\\n    Which, too much minded by herself alone,\\n    May be put from her by society.\\n    Now do you know the reason of this haste.\\n\\n  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-\\n    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\\n\\n                    Enter Juliet.\\n\\n\\n  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!\\n\\n  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\\n\\n  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\\n\\n  Jul. What must be shall be.\\n\\n  Friar. That's a certain text.\\n\\n  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?\\n\\n  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.\\n\\n  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.\\n\\n  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.\\n\\n  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\\n\\n  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,\\n    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.\\n\\n  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.\\n\\n  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,\\n    For it was bad enough before their spite.\\n\\n  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.\\n\\n  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\\n    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.\\n\\n  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.\\n\\n  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.\\n    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,\\n    Or shall I come to you at evening mass\\n\\n  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\\n    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.\\n\\n  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!\\n    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.\\n    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.\\n\\n  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\\n    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!\\n\\n  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\\n    It strains me past the compass of my wits.\\n    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\\n    On Thursday next be married to this County.\\n\\n  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,\\n    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\\n    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\\n    Do thou but call my resolution wise\\n    And with this knife I'll help it presently.\\n    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\\n    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,\\n    Shall be the label to another deed,\\n    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt\\n    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.\\n    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,\\n    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,\\n    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\\n    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that\\n    Which the commission of thy years and art\\n    Could to no issue of true honour bring.\\n    Be not so long to speak. I long to die\\n    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\\n\\n  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\\n    Which craves as desperate an execution\\n    As that is desperate which we would prevent.\\n    If, rather than to marry County Paris\\n    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\\n    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake\\n    A thing like death to chide away this shame,\\n    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;\\n    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.\\n\\n  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\\n    From off the battlements of yonder tower,\\n    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\\n    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,\\n    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,\\n    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,\\n    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\\n    Or bid me go into a new-made grave\\n    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-\\n    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-\\n    And I will do it without fear or doubt,\\n    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.\\n\\n  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent\\n    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.\\n    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\\n    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\\n    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\\n    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;\\n    When presently through all thy veins shall run\\n    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\\n    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;\\n    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\\n    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\\n    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall\\n    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;\\n    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,\\n    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\\n    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\\n    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,\\n    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\\n    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\\n    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\\n    Then, as the manner of our country is,\\n    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier\\n    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\\n    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\\n    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\\n    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;\\n    And hither shall he come; and he and I\\n    Will watch thy waking, and that very night\\n    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\\n    And this shall free thee from this present shame,\\n    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\\n    Abate thy valour in the acting it.\\n\\n  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\\n\\n  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous\\n    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed\\n    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\\n\\n  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\\n    Farewell, dear father.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene II.\\nCapulet's house.\\n\\nEnter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,\\n                        two or three.\\n\\n\\n  Cap.

Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own\\n    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not\\n    with me.\\n\\n  Cap.

Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.\\n    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,\\n    And her immortal part with angels lives.\\n    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault\\n    And presently took post to tell it you.\\n    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,\\n    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.\\n\\n  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!\\n    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper\\n    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.\\n\\n  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.\\n    Your looks are pale and wild and do import\\n    Some misadventure.\\n\\n  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.\\n    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.\\n    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?\\n\\n  Man. No, my good lord.\\n\\n  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone\\n    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.\\n                                               Exit [Balthasar].\\n    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.\\n    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift\\n    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!\\n    I do remember an apothecary,\\n    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted\\n    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,\\n    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,\\n    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;\\n    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\\n    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins\\n    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\\n    A beggarly account of empty boxes,\\n    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\\n    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\\n    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.\\n    Noting this penury, to myself I said,\\n    'An if a man did need a poison now\\n    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,\\n    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'\\n    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,\\n    And this same needy man must sell it me.\\n    As I remember, this should be the house.\\n    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!\\n\\n                        Enter Apothecary.\\n\\n\\n  Apoth. Who calls so loud?\\n\\n  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\\n    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\\n    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\\n    As will disperse itself through all the veins\\n    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,\\n    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath\\n    As violently as hasty powder fir'd\\n    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.\\n\\n  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law\\n    Is death to any he that utters them.\\n\\n  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness\\n    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\\n    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\\n    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:\\n    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;\\n    The world affords no law to make thee rich;\\n    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.\\n\\n  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.\\n\\n  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.\\n\\n  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will\\n    And drink it off, and if you had the strength\\n    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\\n\\n  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,\\n    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,\\n    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\\n    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\\n    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.\\n    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me\\n    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.\\n                                                         Exeunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene II.\\nVerona. Friar Laurence's cell.\\n\\nEnter Friar John to Friar Laurence.\\n\\n\\n  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!\\n\\n                      Enter Friar Laurence.\\n\\n\\n  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.\\n    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\\n    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\\n\\n  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,\\n    One of our order, to associate me\\n    Here in this city visiting the sick,\\n    And finding him, the searchers of the town,\\n    Suspecting that we both were in a house\\n    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,\\n    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,\\n    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.\\n\\n  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?\\n\\n  John. I could not send it- here it is again-\\n    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,\\n    So fearful were they of infection.\\n\\n  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\\n    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,\\n    Of dear import; and the neglecting it\\n    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,\\n    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight\\n    Unto my cell.\\n\\n  John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.\\n\\n  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.\\n    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\\n    She will beshrew me much that Romeo\\n    Hath had no notice of these accidents;\\n    But I will write again to Mantua,\\n    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-\\n    Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScene III.\\nVerona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.\\n\\nEnter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].\\n\\n\\n  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.\\n    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.\\n    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,\\n    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.\\n    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread\\n    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)\\n    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,\\n    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.\\n    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.\\n\\n  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone\\n    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]\\n\\n  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew\\n    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)\\n    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;\\n    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.\\n    The obsequies that I for thee will keep\\n    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.\\n                                                    Whistle Boy.\\n    The boy gives warning something doth approach.\\n    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night\\n    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?\\n    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]\\n\\n       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,\\n                    and a crow of iron.\\n\\n\\n  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\\n    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning\\n    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.\\n    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,\\n    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof\\n    And do not interrupt me in my course.\\n    Why I descend into this bed of death\\n    Is partly to behold my lady's face,\\n    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\\n    A precious ring- a ring that I must use\\n    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\\n    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry\\n    In what I farther shall intend to do,\\n    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint\\n    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\n    The time and my intents are savage-wild,\\n    More fierce and more inexorable far\\n    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\n\\n  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\n\\n  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\\n    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.\\n\\n  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.\\n    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]\\n\\n  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\\n    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,\\n    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\\n    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.\\n                                           Romeo opens the tomb.\\n\\n  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague\\n    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief\\n    It is supposed the fair creature died-\\n    And here is come to do some villanous shame\\n    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\\n    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!\\n    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?\\n    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\\n    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.\\n\\n  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\\n    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.\\n    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\\n    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\\n    But not another sin upon my head\\n    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!\\n    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,\\n    For I come hither arm'd against myself.\\n    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say\\n    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.\\n\\n  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration\\n    And apprehend thee for a felon here.\\n\\n  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\\n                                                     They fight.\\n\\n  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\\n                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]\\n\\n  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,\\n    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]\\n\\n  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\\n    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!\\n    What said my man when my betossed soul\\n    Did not attend him as we rode? I think\\n    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.\\n    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?\\n    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet\\n    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\\n    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\\n    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\n    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,\\n    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\n    This vault a feasting presence full of light.\\n    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.\\n                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]\\n    How oft when men are at the point of death\\n    Have they been merry! which their keepers call\\n    A lightning before death. O, how may I\\n    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\\n    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,\\n    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\n    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet\\n    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\n    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.\\n    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\n    O, what more favour can I do to thee\\n    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\n    To sunder his that was thine enemy?\\n    Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,\\n    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\n    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,\\n    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\n    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?\\n    For fear of that I still will stay with thee\\n    And never from this palace of dim night\\n    Depart again. Here, here will I remain\\n    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\n    Will I set up my everlasting rest\\n    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\n    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\\n    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\\n    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\n    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!\\n    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!\\n    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\n    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\\n    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!\\n    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.\\n\\n    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.\\n\\n\\n  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\\n    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?\\n\\n  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\\n\\n  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,\\n    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light\\n    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\\n    It burneth in the Capels' monument.\\n\\n  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,\\n    One that you love.\\n\\n  Friar. Who is it?\\n\\n  Bal. Romeo.\\n\\n  Friar. How long hath he been there?\\n\\n  Bal. Full half an hour.\\n\\n  Friar. Go with me to the vault.\\n\\n  Bal. I dare not, sir.\\n    My master knows not but I am gone hence,\\n    And fearfully did menace me with death\\n    If I did stay to look on his intents.\\n\\n  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\\n    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\\n\\n  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,\\n    I dreamt my master and another fought,\\n    And that my master slew him.\\n\\n  Friar. Romeo!\\n    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains\\n    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?\\n    What mean these masterless and gory swords\\n    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]\\n    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\\n    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\\n    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.\\n                                                   Juliet rises.\\n\\n  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?\\n    I do remember well where I should be,\\n    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?\\n\\n  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\\n    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\\n    A greater power than we can contradict\\n    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\\n    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\\n    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee\\n    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.\\n    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.\\n    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\\n\\n  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.\\n                                                   Exit [Friar].\\n    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?\\n    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\\n    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop\\n    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\\n    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them\\n    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]\\n    Thy lips are warm!\\n\\n  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?\\n    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!\\n                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]\\n    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.\\n                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].\\n\\n                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.\\n\\n\\n  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.\\n    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.\\n                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]\\n    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;\\n    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\\n    Who here hath lain this two days buried.\\n    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;\\n    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.\\n                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]\\n    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\\n    But the true ground of all these piteous woes\\n    We cannot without circumstance descry.\\n\\n     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].\\n\\n  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\\n\\n          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.\\n\\n  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\\n    We took this mattock and this spade from him\\n    As he was coming from this churchyard side.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.\\n\\n              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].\\n\\n\\n  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,\\n    That calls our person from our morning rest?\\n\\n            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].\\n\\n\\n  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\\n\\n  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'\\n    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,\\n    With open outcry, toward our monument.\\n\\n  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?\\n\\n  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;\\n    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,\\n    Warm and new kill'd.\\n\\n  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\\n\\n  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,\\n    With instruments upon them fit to open\\n    These dead men's tombs.\\n\\n  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\\n    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house\\n    Is empty on the back of Montague,\\n    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!\\n\\n  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell\\n    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.\\n\\n               Enter Montague [and others].\\n\\n\\n  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up\\n    To see thy son and heir more early down.\\n\\n  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!\\n    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.\\n    What further woe conspires against mine age?\\n\\n  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.\\n\\n  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,\\n    To press before thy father to a grave?\\n\\n  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\\n    Till we can clear these ambiguities\\n    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;\\n    And then will I be general of your woes\\n    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\\n    And let mischance be slave to patience.\\n    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.\\n\\n  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,\\n    Yet most suspected, as the time and place\\n    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;\\n    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\n    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.\\n\\n  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.\\n\\n  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath\\n    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.\\n    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\\n    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.\\n    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day\\n    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death\\n    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\n    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.\\n    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\n    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce\\n    To County Paris. Then comes she to me\\n    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean\\n    To rid her from this second marriage,\\n    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.\\n    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)\\n    A sleeping potion; which so took effect\\n    As I intended, for it wrought on her\\n    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\n    That he should hither come as this dire night\\n    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,\\n    Being the time the potion's force should cease.\\n    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\n    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight\\n    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone\\n    At the prefixed hour of her waking\\n    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;\\n    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell\\n    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\n    But when I came, some minute ere the time\\n    Of her awaking, here untimely lay\\n    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\n    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\n    And bear this work of heaven with patience;\\n    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\\n    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\n    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\n    All this I know, and to the marriage\\n    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this\\n    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\\n    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,\\n    Unto the rigour of severest law.\\n\\n  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\\n    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?\\n\\n  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;\\n    And then in post he came from Mantua\\n    To this same place, to this same monument.\\n    This letter he early bid me give his father,\\n    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,\\n    If I departed not and left him there.\\n\\n  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\\n    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?\\n    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?\\n\\n  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\\n    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\n    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\\n    And by-and-by my master drew on him;\\n    And then I ran away to call the watch.\\n\\n  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,\\n    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;\\n    And here he writes that he did buy a poison\\n    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal\\n    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\n    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,\\n    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\n    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\n    And I, for winking at you, discords too,\\n    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.\\n\\n  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\n    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more\\n    Can I demand.\\n\\n  Mon. But I can give thee more;\\n    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,\\n    That whiles Verona by that name is known,\\n    There shall no figure at such rate be set\\n    As that of true and faithful Juliet.\\n\\n  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-\\n    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!\\n\\n  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\\n    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\n    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\\n    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;\\n    For never was a story of more woe\\n    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\n                                                   Exeunt omnes.\"]"

Scene I. Verona. A public place.\\\\\\nEnter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house of Capulet.\\\\\\nSamp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.\\\\\\nGreg. No, for then we should be colliers.\\\\\\nSamp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.\\\\\\nGreg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.\\\\\\nSamp. I strike quickly, being moved.\\\\\\nGreg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\\\\\\nSamp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0wall.\\\\\\nSamp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\\\\\\nGreg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\\\\\\nSamp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off their heads.\\\\\\nGreg. The heads of the maids?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Take it in what sense thou wilt.\\\\\\nGreg. They must take it in sense that feel it.\\\\\\nSamp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.\\\\\\nGreg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of Montagues.\\\\\\nEnter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].\\\\\\nSamp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.\\\\\\nGreg. How? turn thy back and run?\\\\\\nSamp. Fear me not.\\\\\\nGreg. No, marry. I fear thee!\\\\\\nSamp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\\\\\\nGreg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\\\\\\nSamp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is disgrace to them, if they bear it.\\\\\\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\\\\\nSamp. I do bite my thumb, sir.\\\\\\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\\\\\nSamp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?\\\\\\nGreg. [aside to Sampson] No.\\\\\\nSamp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.\\\\\\nGreg. Do you quarrel, sir?\\\\\\nAbr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\\\\\\nSamp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.\\\\\\nAbr. No better.\\\\\\nSamp. Well, sir.\\\\\\nEnter Benvolio.\\\\\\nGreg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my master's kinsmen.\\\\\\nSamp. Yes, better, sir.\\\\\\nAbr. You lie.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0They fight.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben.

Put up thy sword,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Or manage it to part these men with me.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Have at thee, coward!

Give me my long sword, ho!\\\\\\nWife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And flourishes his blade in spite of me.\\\\\\nEnter Old Montague and his Wife.\\\\\\nMon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.\\\\\\nM. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\\\\\\nEnter Prince Escalus, with his Train.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0With purple fountains issuing from your veins!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0On pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And made Verona's ancient citizens\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0If ever you disturb our streets again,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For this time all the rest depart away.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0You, Capulet, shall go along with me;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And, Montague, come you this afternoon,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To know our farther pleasure in this case,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To old Freetown, our common judgment place.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I drew to part them. In the instant came\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0He swung about his head and cut the winds,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Till the Prince came, who parted either part.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Where, underneath the grove of sycamore\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That westward rooteth from the city's side,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0So early walking did I see your son.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Towards him I made; but he was ware of me\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And stole into the covert of the wood.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I- measuring his affections by my own,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Which then most sought where most might not be found,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Being one too many by my weary self-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Should in the furthest East bean to draw\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Away from light steals home my heavy son\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And private in his chamber pens himself,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And makes himself an artificial night.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Black and portentous must this humour prove\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\\\\\\nBen. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\\\\\nMon. I neither know it nor can learn of him\\\\\\nBen. Have you importun'd him by any means?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But he, his own affections' counsellor,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Is to himself- I will not say how true-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But to himself so secret and so close,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0So far from sounding and discovery,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0As is the bud bit with an envious worm\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0We would as willingly give cure as know.\\\\\\nEnter Romeo.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Exeunt [Montague and Wife].\\\\\\nBen. Good morrow, cousin.\\\\\\nRom. Is the day so young?\\\\\\nBen. But new struck nine.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Was that my father that went hence so fast?\\\\\\nBen. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\\\\\\nRom. Not having that which having makes them short.\\\\\\nBen. In love?\\\\\\nRom. Out-\\\\\\nBen. Of love?\\\\\\nRom. Out of her favour where I am in love.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Should without eyes see pathways to his will!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0O anything, of nothing first create!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Dost thou not laugh?\\\\\\nBen. No, coz, I rather weep.\\\\\\nRom. Good heart, at what?\\\\\\nBen. At thy good heart's oppression.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0What is it else? A madness most discreet,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Farewell, my coz.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. Soft! I will go along.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This is not Romeo, he's some other where.\\\\\\nBen. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?\\\\\\nRom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. Groan? Why, no;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But sadly tell me who.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\\\\\nBen. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.\\\\\\nRom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.\\\\\\nBen. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She will not stay the siege of loving terms,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0O, she's rich in beauty; only poor\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\\\\\nBen. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For beauty, starv'd with her severity,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To merit bliss by making me despair.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\\\\\\nBen. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.\\\\\\nRom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Examine other beauties.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. 'Tis the way\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To call hers (exquisite) in question more.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0He that is strucken blind cannot forget\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0What doth her beauty serve but as a note\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\\\\\\nBen. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt.\\\\\\nScene II. A Street.\\\\\\nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For men so old as we to keep the peace.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0My child is yet a stranger in the world,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Let two more summers wither in their pride\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\\\\\\nPar. Younger than she are happy mothers made.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She is the hopeful lady of my earth.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0My will to her consent is but a part.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0An she agree, within her scope of choice\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Lies my consent and fair according voice.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Whereto I have invited many a guest,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Such as I love; and you among the store,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0At my poor house look to behold this night\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Such comfort as do lusty young men feel\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0When well apparell'd April on the heel\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Of limping Winter treads, even such delight\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Among fresh female buds shall you this night\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Inherit at my house.

Capulet's house.\\\\\\nEnter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.\\\\\\nWife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!\\\\\\nEnter Juliet.\\\\\\nJul. How now? Who calls?\\\\\\nNurse. Your mother.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Jul. Madam, I am here.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0What is your will?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\\\\\\nNurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\\\\\\nWife. She's not fourteen.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She is not fourteen. How long is it now\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To Lammastide?\\\\\\nWife. A fortnight and odd days.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She was too good for me. But, as I said,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Of all the days of the year, upon that day;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0My lord and you were then at Mantua.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To bid me trudge.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And since that time it is eleven years,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She could have run and waddled all about;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For even the day before, she broke her brow;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And then my husband (God be with his soul!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0'A was a merry man) took up the child.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To see now how a jest shall come about!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'\\\\\\nWife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'\\\\\\nJul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0How stands your disposition to be married?\\\\\\nJul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Are made already mothers. By my count,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I was your mother much upon these years\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0As all the world- why he's a man of wax.\\\\\\nWife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.\\\\\\nNurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This night you shall behold him at our feast.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Examine every married lineament,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And see how one another lends content;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Find written in the margent of his eyes,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This precious book of love, this unbound lover,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To beautify him only lacks a cover.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For fair without the fair within to hide.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0So shall you share all that he doth possess,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0By having him making yourself no less.\\\\\\nNurse.

I'll look to like, if looking liking move;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But no more deep will I endart mine eye\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\\\\\\nEnter Servingman.\\\\\\nServ.

A street.\\\\\\nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;\\\\\\nTorchbearers.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Or shall we on without apology?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0After the prompter, for our entrance;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But, let them measure us by what they will,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Being but heavy, I will bear the light.\\\\\\nMer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And soar with them above a common bound.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To soar with his light feathers; and so bound\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Too great oppression for a tender thing.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Give me a case to put my visage in.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0A visor for a visor! What care I\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0What curious eye doth quote deformities?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But every man betake him to his legs.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I'll be a candle-holder and look on;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\\\\\\nRom. Nay, that's not so.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mer. I mean, sir, in delay\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Five times in that ere once in our five wits.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But 'tis no wit to go.\\\\\\nMer. Why, may one ask?\\\\\\nRom. I dreamt a dream to-night.\\\\\\nMer. And so did I.\\\\\\nRom. Well, what was yours?\\\\\\nMer. That dreamers often lie.\\\\\\nRom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0In shape no bigger than an agate stone\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0On the forefinger of an alderman,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Drawn with a team of little atomies\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Not half so big as a round little worm\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And in this state she 'gallops night by night\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Then dreams he of another benefice.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That plats the manes of horses in the night\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Which once untangled much misfortune bodes\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That presses them and learns them first to bear,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Making them women of good carriage.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This is she-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Thou talk'st of nothing.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Mer. True, I talk of dreams;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Which are the children of an idle brain,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Which is as thin of substance as the air,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Even now the frozen bosom of the North\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0With this night's revels and expire the term\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0By some vile forfeit of untimely death.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But he that hath the steerage of my course\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Direct my sail!

Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a02. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0His son is thirty.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. Will you tell me that?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0His son was but a ward two years ago.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0hand Of yonder knight?\\\\\\nServ. I know not, sir.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\\\\\\nCap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0A villain, that is hither come in spite\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To scorn at our solemnity this night.\\\\\\nCap. Young Romeo is it?\\\\\\nTyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0'A bears him like a portly gentleman,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I would not for the wealth of all this town\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Here in my house do him disparagement.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Therefore be patient, take no note of him.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0It is my will; the which if thou respect,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I'll not endure him.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. He shall be endur'd.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Am I the master here, or you? Go to!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0You'll make a mutiny among my guests!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!\\\\\\nTyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. Go to, go to!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall. Exit.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\\\\\\nRom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\\\\\\nJul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\\\\\\nJul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd. [Kisses her.]\\\\\\nJul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Give me my sin again. [Kisses her.]\\\\\\nJul. You kiss by th' book.\\\\\\nNurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.\\\\\\nRom. What is her mother?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. Marry, bachelor,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Her mother is the lady of the house.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I tell you, he that can lay hold of her\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Shall have the chinks.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Rom. Is she a Capulet?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.\\\\\\nBen. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.\\\\\\nRom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0I'll to my rest.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].\\\\\\nJul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?\\\\\\nNurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.\\\\\\nJul. What's he that now is going out of door?\\\\\\nNurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.\\\\\\nJul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?\\\\\\nNurse. I know not.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0My grave is like to be my wedding bed.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0The only son of your great enemy.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Too early seen unknown, and known too late!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Prodigious birth of love it is to me\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That I must love a loathed enemy.\\\\\\nNurse. What's this? what's this?\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Of one I danc'd withal.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0One calls within, 'Juliet.'\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Nurse. Anon, anon!\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone. Exeunt.\\\\\\nPROLOGUE\\\\\\nEnter Chorus.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And young affection gapes to be his heir;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Being held a foe, he may not have access\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0And she as much in love, her means much less\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0To meet her new beloved anywhere;\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,\\\\\\n\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0\\\\'a0Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.\\\\\\nExit.}\"}}"

       "  'Text': \"I. Scene I.Verona. A public place.Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the houseof Capulet.  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the    wall.  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off    their heads.  Greg. The heads of the maids?  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.    Take it in what sense thou wilt.  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I    am a pretty piece of flesh.  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of    Montagues.           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?  Samp. Fear me not.  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is    disgrace to them, if they bear it.  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my    thumb, sir.  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as    you.  Abr. No better.  Samp. Well, sir.                        Enter Benvolio.  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my    master's kinsmen.  Samp. Yes, better, sir.  Abr. You lie.  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.                                                     They fight.  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.                          Enter Tybalt.  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,    Or manage it to part these men with me.  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or                          partisans.  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets    And made Verona's ancient citizens    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.    If ever you disturb our streets again,    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.    For this time all the rest depart away.    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,    To know our farther pleasure in this case,    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.    I drew to part them. In the instant came    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,    He swung about his head and cut the winds,    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore    That westward rooteth from the city's side,    So early walking did I see your son.    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me    And stole into the covert of the wood.    I- measuring his affections by my own,    Which then most sought where most might not be found,    Being one too many by my weary self-    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun    Should in the furthest East bean to draw    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,    Away from light steals home my heavy son    And private in his chamber pens himself,    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight    And makes himself an artificial night.    Black and portentous must this humour prove    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;    But he, his own affections' counsellor,    Is to himself- I will not say how true-    But to himself so secret and so close,    So far from sounding and discovery,    As is the bud bit with an envious worm    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,    We would as willingly give cure as know.                       Enter Romeo.  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.  Rom. Is the day so young?  Ben. But new struck nine.  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.    Was that my father that went hence so fast?  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.  Ben. In love?  Rom. Out-  Ben. Of love?  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!    O anything, of nothing first create!    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.    Dost thou not laugh?  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.  Rom. Good heart, at what?  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.    What is it else? A madness most discreet,    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.    Farewell, my coz.  Ben. Soft! I will go along.    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?  Ben. Groan? Why, no;    But sadly tell me who.  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,    To merit bliss by making me despair.    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.    Examine other beauties.  Rom. 'Tis the way    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.    He that is strucken blind cannot forget    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,    What doth her beauty serve but as a note    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.Scene II.A Street.Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,    For men so old as we to keep the peace.  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:    My child is yet a stranger in the world,    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;    Let two more summers wither in their pride    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;    My will to her consent is but a part.    An she agree, within her scope of choice    Lies my consent and fair according voice.    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,    Whereto I have invited many a guest,    Such as I love; and you among the store,    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.    At my poor house look to behold this night    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel    When well apparell'd April on the heel    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight    Among fresh female buds shall you this night    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,    And like her most whose merit most shall be;    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,    sirrah, trudge about    Through fair Verona; find those persons out    Whose names are written there, and to them say,    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,    And the rank poison of the old will die.  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.  Ben. For what, I pray thee?  Rom. For your broken shin.  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can    you read anything you see?  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;      The lady widow of Vitruvio;      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;      Lucio and the lively Helena.'    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they    come?  Serv. Up.  Rom. Whither?  Serv. To supper, to our house.  Rom. Whose house?  Serv. My master's.  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray    come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;    With all the admired beauties of Verona.    Go thither, and with unattainted eye    Compare her face with some that I shall show,    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd    Your lady's love against some other maid    That I will show you shining at this feast,    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.  Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,    But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]Scene III.Capulet's house.Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.  Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!                         Enter Juliet.  Jul. How now? Who calls?  Nurse. Your mother.  Jul. Madam, I am here.    What is your will?  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.  Wife. She's not fourteen.  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-    She is not fourteen. How long is it now    To Lammastide?  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;    She was too good for me. But, as I said,    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.    My lord and you were then at Mantua.    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,    To bid me trudge.    And since that time it is eleven years,    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,    She could have run and waddled all about;    For even the day before, she broke her brow;    And then my husband (God be with his soul!    'A was a merry man) took up the child.    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'    To see now how a jest shall come about!    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,    How stands your disposition to be married?  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,    Are made already mothers. By my count,    I was your mother much upon these years    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.  Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?    This night you shall behold him at our feast.    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;    Examine every married lineament,    And see how one another lends content;    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies    Find written in the margent of his eyes,    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,    To beautify him only lacks a cover.    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride    For fair without the fair within to hide.    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;    So shall you share all that he doth possess,    By having him making yourself no less.  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;    But no more deep will I endart mine eye    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.                        Enter Servingman.  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,    my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you    follow straight.  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].    Juliet, the County stays.  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.                                                         Exeunt.Scene IV.A street.Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;Torchbearers.  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?    Or shall we on without apology?  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke    After the prompter, for our entrance;    But, let them measure us by what they will,    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings    And soar with them above a common bound.  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-    Too great oppression for a tender thing.  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.    Give me a case to put my visage in.    A visor for a visor! What care I    What curious eye doth quote deformities?    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in    But every man betake him to his legs.  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!  Rom. Nay, that's not so.  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;    But 'tis no wit to go.  Mer. Why, may one ask?  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.  Mer. And so did I.  Rom. Well, what was yours?  Mer. That dreamers often lie.  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes    In shape no bigger than an agate stone    On the forefinger of an alderman,    Drawn with a team of little atomies    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,    Not half so big as a round little worm    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.    And in this state she 'gallops night by night    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,    Then dreams he of another benefice.    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab    That plats the manes of horses in the night    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,    That presses them and learns them first to bear,    Making them women of good carriage.    This is she-  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!    Thou talk'st of nothing.  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;    Which are the children of an idle brain,    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;    Which is as thin of substance as the air,    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes    Even now the frozen bosom of the North    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date    With this night's revels and expire the term    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.    But he that hath the steerage of my course    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!  Ben. Strike, drum.                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]Scene V.Capulet's house.Servingmen come forth with napkins.  1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's    hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.  1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,    look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone andNell.    Anthony, and Potpan!  2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.  1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and    sought for, in the great chamber.  3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day    That I have worn a visor and could tell    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.                                    Music plays, and they dance.    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,    For you and I are past our dancing days.    How long is't now since last yourself and I    Were in a mask?  2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.  Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!    'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,    Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.  2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;    His son is thirty.  Cap. Will you tell me that?    His son was but a ward two years ago.  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the    hand Of yonder knight?  Serv. I know not, sir.  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;    A villain, that is hither come in spite    To scorn at our solemnity this night.  Cap. Young Romeo is it?  Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.    'A bears him like a portly gentleman,    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.    I would not for the wealth of all this town    Here in my house do him disparagement.    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.    It is my will; the which if thou respect,    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.    I'll not endure him.  Cap. He shall be endur'd.    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!  Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.  Cap. Go to, go to!    You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.    You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-    Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!    Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]  Jul. You kiss by th' book.  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.  Rom. What is her mother?  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,    Her mother is the lady of the house.    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her    Shall have the chinks.  Rom. Is she a Capulet?    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.  Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;    I'll to my rest.                              Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?  Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?  Nurse. I know not.  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,    The only son of your great enemy.  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!    Prodigious birth of love it is to me    That I must love a loathed enemy.  Nurse. What's this? what's this?  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now    Of one I danc'd withal.                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'  Nurse. Anon, anon!    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.PROLOGUEEnter Chorus.  Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,    And young affection gapes to be his heir;    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.    Being held a foe, he may not have access    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,    And she as much in love, her means much less    To meet her new beloved anywhere;    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.Exit.\"},\n",

Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!  Mer. He is wise,    And, on my life, hath stol\\'n him home to bed.  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.    Call, good Mercutio.  Mer. Nay, I\\'ll conjure too.    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!    Cry but \\'Ay me!\\' pronounce but \\'love\\' and \\'dove\\';    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim    When King Cophetua lov\\'d the beggar maid!    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.    I conjure thee by Rosaline\\'s bright eyes.    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.  Mer. This cannot anger him. \\'Twould anger him    To raise a spirit in his mistress\\' circle    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand    Till she had laid it and conjur\\'d it down.    That were some spite; my invocation    Is fair and honest: in his mistress\\' name,    I conjure only but to raise up him.  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees    To be consorted with the humorous night.    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.    Now will he sit under a medlar tree    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were    An open et cetera, thou a pop\\'rin pear!    Romeo, good night. I\\'ll to my truckle-bed;    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.    Come, shall we go?  Ben. Go then, for \\'tis in vain    \\'To seek him here that means not to be found.                                                         Exeunt.Scene II.Capulet\\'s orchard.Enter Romeo.  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.                     Enter Juliet above at a window.    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,    Who is already sick and pale with grief    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.    Be not her maid, since she is envious.    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.    It is my lady; O, it is my love!    O that she knew she were!    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.    I am too bold; \\'tis not to me she speaks.    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,    Having some business, do entreat her eyes    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven    Would through the airy region stream so bright    That birds would sing and think it were not night.    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!    O that I were a glove upon that hand,    That I might touch that cheek!  Jul. Ay me!  Rom. She speaks.    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art    As glorious to this night, being o\\'er my head,    As is a winged messenger of heaven    Unto the white-upturned wond\\'ring eyes    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds    And sails upon the bosom of the air.  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,    And I\\'ll no longer be a Capulet.  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?  Jul. \\'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.    What\\'s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!    What\\'s in a name? That which we call a rose    By any other name would smell as sweet.    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call\\'d,    Retain that dear perfection which he owes    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;    And for that name, which is no part of thee,    Take all myself.  Rom. I take thee at thy word.    Call me but love, and I\\'ll be new baptiz\\'d;    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen\\'d in night,    So stumblest on my counsel?  Rom. By a name    I know not how to tell thee who I am.    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,    Because it is an enemy to thee.    Had I it written, I would tear the word.  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words    Of that tongue\\'s utterance, yet I know the sound.    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.  Jul. How cam\\'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,    And the place death, considering who thou art,    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.  Rom. With love\\'s light wings did I o\\'erperch these walls;    For stony limits cannot hold love out,    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,    And I am proof against their enmity.  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.  Rom. I have night\\'s cloak to hide me from their sight;    And but thou love me, let them find me here.    My life were better ended by their hate    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.  Jul. By whose direction found\\'st thou out this place?  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far    As that vast shore wash\\'d with the farthest sea,    I would adventure for such merchandise.  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say \\'Ay\\';    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear\\'st,    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers\\' perjuries,    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,    I\\'ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;    But trust me, gentleman, I\\'ll prove more true    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.    I should have been more strange, I must confess,    But that thou overheard\\'st, ere I was ware,    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,    And not impute this yielding to light love,    Which the dark night hath so discovered.  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th\\' inconstant moon,    That monthly changes in her circled orb,    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.  Rom. What shall I swear by?  Jul. Do not swear at all;    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,    Which is the god of my idolatry,    And I\\'ll believe thee.  Rom. If my heart\\'s dear love-  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,    I have no joy of this contract to-night.    It is too rash, too unadvis\\'d, too sudden;    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be    Ere one can say \\'It lightens.\\' Sweet, good night!    This bud of love, by summer\\'s ripening breath,    May prove a beauteous flow\\'r when next we meet.    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?  Rom. Th\\' exchange of thy love\\'s faithful vow for mine.  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;    And yet I would it were to give again.  Rom. Would\\'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,    The more I have, for both are infinite.    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!                                           [Nurse] calls within.    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,    Being in night, all this is but a dream,    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.                       Enter Juliet above.  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.    If that thy bent of love be honourable,    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,    By one that I\\'ll procure to come to thee,    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;    And all my fortunes at thy foot I\\'ll lay    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.  Nurse. (within) Madam!  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,    I do beseech thee-  Nurse. (within) Madam!  Jul. By-and-by I come.-    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.    To-morrow will I send.  Rom. So thrive my soul-  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.                     Enter Juliet again, [above].  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer\\'s voice    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine    With repetition of my Romeo\\'s name.    Romeo!  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.    How silver-sweet sound lovers\\' tongues by night,    Like softest music to attending ears!  Jul. Romeo!  Rom. My dear?  Jul. At what o\\'clock to-morrow    Shall I send to thee?  Rom. By the hour of nine.  Jul. I will not fail. \\'Tis twenty years till then.    I have forgot why I did call thee back.  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,    Rememb\\'ring how I love thy company.  Rom. And I\\'ll still stay, to have thee still forget,    Forgetting any other home but this.  Jul. \\'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-    And yet no farther than a wanton\\'s bird,    That lets it hop a little from her hand,    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,    So loving-jealous of his liberty.  Rom. I would I were thy bird.  Jul. Sweet, so would I.    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.                                                         [Exit.]  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!    Hence will I to my ghostly father\\'s cell,    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell. ExitScene III.Friar Laurence\\'s cell.Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.  Friar. The grey-ey\\'d morn smiles on the frowning night,    Check\\'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels    From forth day\\'s path and Titan\\'s fiery wheels.    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye    The day to cheer and night\\'s dank dew to dry,    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.    The earth that\\'s nature\\'s mother is her tomb.    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;    And from her womb children of divers kind    We sucking on her natural bosom find;    Many for many virtues excellent,    None but for some, and yet all different.    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live    But to the earth some special good doth give;    Nor aught so good but, strain\\'d from that fair use,    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,    And vice sometime\\'s by action dignified.    Within the infant rind of this small flower    Poison hath residence, and medicine power;    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.    Two such opposed kings encamp them still    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;    And where the worser is predominant,    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.                        Enter Romeo.  Rom. Good morrow, father.  Friar. Benedicite!    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?    Young son, it argues a distempered head    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.    Care keeps his watch in every old man\\'s eye,    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;    But where unbruised youth with unstuff\\'d brain    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure    Thou art uprous\\'d with some distemp\\'rature;    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.    I have forgot that name, and that name\\'s woe.  Friar. That\\'s my good son! But where hast thou been then?  Rom. I\\'ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.    I have been feasting with mine enemy,    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me    That\\'s by me wounded. Both our remedies    Within thy help and holy physic lies.    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,    My intercession likewise steads my foe.  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.  Rom. Then plainly know my heart\\'s dear love is set    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,    And all combin\\'d, save what thou must combine    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how    We met, we woo\\'d, and made exchange of vow,    I\\'ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,    That thou consent to marry us to-day.  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,    So soon forsaken? Young men\\'s love then lies    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine    Hath wash\\'d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!    How much salt water thrown away in waste,    To season love, that of it doth not taste!    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit    Of an old tear that is not wash\\'d off yet.    If e\\'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.    And art thou chang\\'d? Pronounce this sentence then:    Women may fall when there\\'s no strength in men.  Rom. Thou chid\\'st me oft for loving Rosaline.  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.  Rom. And bad\\'st me bury love.  Friar. Not in a grave    To lay one in, another out to have.  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.    The other did not so.  Friar. O, she knew well    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.    But come, young waverer, come go with me.    In one respect I\\'ll thy assistant be;    For this alliance may so happy prove    To turn your households\\' rancour to pure love.  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.                                                         Exeunt.Scene IV.A street.Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?    Came he not home to-night?  Ben. Not to his father\\'s. I spoke with his man.  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,    Hath sent a letter to his father\\'s house.  Mer. A challenge, on my life.  Ben. Romeo will answer it.  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter\\'s master, how he dares,    being dared.  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb\\'d with a white    wench\\'s black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy\\'s    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he\\'s the    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.  Ben. The what?  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-    these new tuners of accent! \\'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very    tall man! a very good whore!\\' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi\\'s, who stand    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old    bench? O, their bones, their bones!                               Enter Romeo.  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There\\'s a French    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit    fairly last night.  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.  Mer. That\\'s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a    man to bow in the hams.  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.  Rom. A most courteous exposition.  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.  Rom. Pink for flower.  Mer. Right.  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower\\'d.  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I\\'ll cry a match.  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not    there for the goose.  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv\\'d in to a sweet goose?  Mer. O, here\\'s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch    narrow to an ell broad!  Rom. I stretch it out for that word \\'broad,\\' which, added to    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in    a hole.  Ben. Stop there, stop there!  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.  Mer. O, thou art deceiv\\'d! I would have made it short; for I    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to    occupy the argument no longer.  Rom. Here\\'s goodly gear!                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].  Mer. A sail, a sail!  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.  Nurse. Peter!  Peter. Anon.  Nurse. My fan, Peter.  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan\\'s the fairer face of    the two.  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.  Nurse. Is it good-den?  Mer. \\'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is    now upon the prick of noon.  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. \\'For himself to mar,\\'    quoth \\'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the    young Romeo?  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest    of that name, for fault of a worse.  Nurse. You say well.  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i\\' faith! wisely,    wisely.  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!  Rom. What hast thou found?  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is    something stale and hoar ere it be spent                                     He walks by them and sings.                   An old hare hoar,                   And an old hare hoar,                Is very good meat in Lent;                   But a hare that is hoar                   Is too much for a score                When it hoars ere it be spent.    Romeo, will you come to your father\\'s? We\\'ll to dinner thither.  Rom. I will follow you.  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,    [sings] lady, lady, lady.                                      Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant    was this that was so full of his ropery?  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.  Nurse. An \\'a speak anything against me, I\\'ll take him down, an\\'a    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,    I\\'ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the    law on my side.  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead    her into a fool\\'s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were    an ill thing to be off\\'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto    thee-  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.  Rom. Bid her devise    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;    And there she shall at Friar Laurence\\' cell    Be shriv\\'d and married. Here is for thy pains.  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.    Within this hour my man shall be with thee    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,    Which to the high topgallant of my joy    Must be my convoy in the secret night.    Farewell. Be trusty, and I\\'ll quit thy pains.    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.  Rom. What say\\'st thou, my dear nurse?  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne\\'er hear say,    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?  Rom. I warrant thee my man\\'s as true as steel.  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!    when \\'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;    but I\\'ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both    with a letter?  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that\\'s the dog\\'s name. R is for the- No; I    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you    good to hear it.  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!  Peter. Anon.  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.                                                         Exeunt.Scene V.Capulet\\'s orchard.Enter Juliet.  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;    In half an hour she \\'promis\\'d to return.    Perchance she cannot meet him. That\\'s not so.    O, she is lame! Love\\'s heralds should be thoughts,    Which ten times faster glide than the sun\\'s beams    Driving back shadows over low\\'ring hills.    Therefore do nimble-pinion\\'d doves draw Love,    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill    Of this day\\'s journey, and from nine till twelve    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,    And his to me,    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.                      Enter Nurse [and Peter].    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.                                                   [Exit Peter.]  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look\\'st thou sad?    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news    By playing it to me with so sour a face.  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.    Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?    Do you not see that I am out of breath?  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath    To say to me that thou art out of breath?    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.    Say either, and I\\'ll stay the circumstance.    Let me be satisfied, is\\'t good or bad?  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better    than any man\\'s, yet his leg excels all men\\'s; and for a hand and a    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk\\'d on, yet    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I\\'ll    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serveGod.    What, have you din\\'d at home?  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.    What says he of our marriage? What of that?  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.    My back o\\' t\\' other side,- ah, my back, my back!    Beshrew your heart for sending me about    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!  Jul. I\\' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where    is your mother?  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!    \\'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,    \"Where is your mother?\"\\'  Nurse. O God\\'s Lady dear!    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?    Henceforward do your messages yourself.  Jul. Here\\'s such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?  Jul. I have.  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence\\' cell;    There stays a husband to make you a wife.    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:    They\\'ll be in scarlet straight at any news.    Hie you to church; I must another way,    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love    Must climb a bird\\'s nest soon when it is dark.    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.    Go; I\\'ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.                                                         Exeunt.Scene VI.Friar Laurence\\'s cell.Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy    That one short minute gives me in her sight.    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-    It is enough I may but call her mine.  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness    And in the taste confounds the appetite.    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.                     Enter Juliet.    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot    Will ne\\'er wear out the everlasting flint.    A lover may bestride the gossamer    That idles in the wanton summer air,    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy    Be heap\\'d like mine, and that thy skill be more    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath    This neighbour air, and let rich music\\'s tongue    Unfold the imagin\\'d happiness that both    Receive in either by this dear encounter.  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.    They are but beggars that can count their worth;    But my true love is grown to such excess    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.

And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and    says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be    moved.  Ben. And what to?  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog    that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt    tutor me from quarrelling!  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!                       Enter Tybalt and others.  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.  Mer. By my heel, I care not.  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.  Mer. And but one word with one of us?    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me    occasion.  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my    fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.    Either withdraw unto some private place    And reason coldly of your grievances,    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.  Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,                        Enter Romeo.  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.  Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!    Your worship in that sense may call him man.  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford    No better term than this: thou art a villain.  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,    But love thee better than thou canst devise    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;    And so good Capulet, which name I tender    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.That I    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your    ears ere it be out.  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!                                                   [They fight.]  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies                                           [with his Followers].  Mer. I am hurt.    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.    Is he gone and hath nothing?  Ben. What, art thou hurt?  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.                                                    [Exit Page.]  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this    world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,a    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.  Rom. I thought all for the best.  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,    And soundly too. Your houses!                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel                      Enter Benvolio.  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;    This but begins the woe others must end.                       Enter Tybalt.  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?    Away to heaven respective lenity,    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul    Is but a little way above our heads,    Staying for thine to keep him company.    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,    Shalt with him hence.  Rom. This shall determine that.                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!  Ben. Why dost thou stay?                                                     Exit Romeo.                      Enter Citizens.  Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,                     and [others].  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.    O cousin, cousin!  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats    Cold death aside and with the other sends    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,    And all those twenty could but kill one life.    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;    His fault concludes but what the law should end,    The life of Tybalt.  Prince. And for that offence    Immediately we do exile him hence.    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.                                                         Exeunt.Scene II.Capulet's orchard.Enter Juliet alone.  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner    As Phaeton would whip you to the West    And bring in cloudy night immediately.    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,    And learn me how to lose a winning match,    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,    Think true love acted simple modesty.    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,    Take him and cut him out in little stars,    And he will make the face of heaven so fine    That all the world will be in love with night    And pay no worship to the garish sun.    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day    As is the night before some festival    To an impatient child that hath new robes    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,                Enter Nurse, with cords.    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords    That Romeo bid thee fetch?  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.                                             [Throws them down.]  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!    We are undone, lady, we are undone!    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?  Nurse. Romeo can,    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'    If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman    That ever I should live to see thee dead!  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!    For who is living, if those two are gone?  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!    Despised substance of divinest show!    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-    A damned saint, an honourable villain!    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?    Was ever book containing such vile matter    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell    In such a gorgeous palace!  Nurse. There's no trust,    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.    Shame come to Romeo!  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd    Sole monarch of the universal earth.    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!    Your tributary drops belong to woe,    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;    But O, it presses to my memory    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.    He made you for a highway to my bed;    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight    And bid him come to take his last farewell.                                                         Exeunt.Scene III.Friar Laurence's cell.Enter Friar [Laurence].  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,    And thou art wedded to calamity.                         Enter Romeo.  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand    That I yet know not?  Friar. Too familiar    Is my dear son with such sour company.    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-    Not body's death, but body's banishment.  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';    For exile hath more terror in his look,    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,    Live here in heaven and may look on her;    But Romeo may not. More validity,    More honourable state, more courtship lives    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;    But Romeo may not- he is banished.    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;    They are free men, but I am banished.    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,    Doting like me, and like me banished,    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.                                                 Knock [within].  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.    I come from Lady Juliet.  Friar. Welcome then.                       Enter Nurse.  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,    Just in her case!  Friar. O woeful sympathy!    Piteous predicament!  Nurse. Even so lies she,    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!    Why should you fall into so deep an O?  Rom. (rises) Nurse-  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy    With blood remov'd but little from her own?    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,    And then down falls again.  Rom. As if that name,    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,    In what vile part of this anatomy    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote    The unreasonable fury of a beast.    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,    By doing damned hate upon thyself?    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,    And usest none in that true use indeed    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax    Digressing from the valour of a man;    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,    is get afire by thine own ignorance,    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;    Happiness courts thee in her best array;    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.    Romeo is coming.  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:    Either be gone before the watch be set,    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,    And he shall signify from time to time    Every good hap to you that chances here.    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.    Farewell.                                                         Exeunt.Scene IV.Capulet's houseEnter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily    That we have had no time to move our daughter.    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.    I promise you, but for your company,    I would have been abed an hour ago.  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-    But, soft! what day is this?  Par. Monday, my lord.  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her    She shall be married to this noble earl.    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,    It may be thought we held him carelessly,    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!    Afore me, It is so very very late    That we may call it early by-and-by.    Good night.                                                          ExeuntScene V.Capulet's orchard.Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.    It is some meteor that the sun exhales    To be to thee this night a torchbearer    And light thee on the way to Mantua.    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.    I have more care to stay than will to go.    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.    Some say the lark makes sweet division;    This doth not so, for she divideth us.    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!                          Enter Nurse.  Nurse. Madam!  Jul. Nurse?  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.    The day is broke; be wary, look about.  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.                                                         [Exit.]  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.                                                  He goeth down.  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,    For in a minute there are many days.    O, by this count I shall be much in years    Ere I again behold my Romeo!  Rom. Farewell!    I will omit no opportunity    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve    For sweet discourses in our time to come.  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!Exit.  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long    But send him back.  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.    Is she not down so late, or up so early?    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?                       Enter Mother.  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?  Jul. Madam, I am not well.  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend    Which you weep for.  Jul. Feeling so the loss,    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.  Jul. What villain, madam?  Lady. That same villain Romeo.  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.    Madam, if you could find out but a man    To bear a poison, I would temper it;    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,    And see how be will take it at your hands.                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,    But for the sunset of my brother's son    It rains downright.    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?    Evermore show'ring? In one little body    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,    Without a sudden calm will overset    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?    Have you delivered to her our decree?  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.    I would the fool were married to her grave!  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.    Proud can I never be of what I hate,    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?    'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!    You tallow-face!  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday    Or never after look me in the face.    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest    That God had lent us but this only child;    But now I see this one is one too much,    And that we have a curse in having her.    Out on her, hilding!  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!  Nurse. I speak no treason.  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!  Nurse. May not one speak?  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,    For here we need it not.  Lady. You are too hot.  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,    At home, abroad, alone, in company,    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been    To have her match'd; and having now provided    A gentleman of princely parentage,    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-    And then to have a wretched puling fool,    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.    Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds    That sees into the bottom of my grief?    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.    How shall that faith return again to earth    Unless that husband send it me from heaven    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems    Upon so soft a subject as myself!    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?    Some comfort, nurse.  Nurse. Faith, here it is.    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,    I think it best you married with the County.    O, he's a lovely gentleman!    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,    I think you are happy in this second match,    For it excels your first; or if it did not,    Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were    As living here and you no use of him.  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.  Jul. Amen!  Nurse. What?  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,    To make confession and to be absolv'd.  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.    If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.\"},\n",

       "  'Text': \"IV. Scene I.Friar Laurence's cell.Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.  Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.  Par. My father Capulet will have it so,    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.    Uneven is the course; I like it not.  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage    To stop the inundation of her tears,    Which, too much minded by herself alone,    May be put from her by society.    Now do you know the reason of this haste.  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.                    Enter Juliet.  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.  Jul. What must be shall be.  Friar. That's a certain text.  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,    For it was bad enough before their spite.  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,    Or shall I come to you at evening mass  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;    It strains me past the compass of my wits.    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,    On Thursday next be married to this County.  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,    Do thou but call my resolution wise    And with this knife I'll help it presently.    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,    Shall be the label to another deed,    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that    Which the commission of thy years and art    Could to no issue of true honour bring.    Be not so long to speak. I long to die    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,    Which craves as desperate an execution    As that is desperate which we would prevent.    If, rather than to marry County Paris    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake    A thing like death to chide away this shame,    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,    From off the battlements of yonder tower,    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;    Or bid me go into a new-made grave    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-    And I will do it without fear or doubt,    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;    When presently through all thy veins shall run    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.    Then, as the manner of our country is,    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;    And hither shall he come; and he and I    Will watch thy waking, and that very night    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.    And this shall free thee from this present shame,    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear    Abate thy valour in the acting it.  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.    Farewell, dear father.                                                         Exeunt.Scene II.Capulet's house.Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,                        two or three.  Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.                                            [Exit a Servingman.]    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.  Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can    lick their fingers.  Cap. How canst thou try them so?  Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not    with me.  Cap. Go, begone.                                                Exit Servingman.    We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.  Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.                        Enter Juliet.  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin    Of disobedient opposition    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!    Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell    And gave him what becomed love I might,    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.  Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.    This is as't should be. Let me see the County.    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,    All our whole city is much bound to him.  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet    To help me sort such needful ornaments    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.  Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.  Mother. We shall be short in our provision.    'Tis now near night.  Cap. Tush, I will stir about,    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself    To County Paris, to prepare him up    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.                                                         Exeunt.Scene III.Juliet's chamber.Enter Juliet and Nurse.  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;    For I have need of many orisons    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.                          Enter Mother.  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.    So please you, let me now be left alone,    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;    For I am sure you have your hands full all    In this so sudden business.  Mother. Good night.    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.                                      Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins    That almost freezes up the heat of life.    I'll call them back again to comfort me.    Nurse!- What should she do here?    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.    Come, vial.    What if this mixture do not work at all?    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.                                             Lays down a dagger.    What if it be a poison which the friar    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd    Because he married me before to Romeo?    I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,    For he hath still been tried a holy man.    I will not entertain so bad a thought.    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,    I wake before the time that Romeo    Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?    Or, if I live, is it not very like    The horrible conceit of death and night,    Together with the terror of the place-    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle    Where for this many hundred years the bones    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,    At some hours in the night spirits resort-    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,    Environed with all these hideous fears,    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body    Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.Scene IV.Capulet's house.Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.                       Enter Old Capulet.  Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.    Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;    Spare not for cost.  Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow    For this night's watching.  Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.  Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;    But I will watch you from such watching now.                                          Exeunt Lady and Nurse.  Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!  Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.    What is there? Now, fellow,  Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.  Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier      logs.    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.  Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs    And never trouble Peter for the matter.  Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.    The County will be here with music straight,    For so he said he would.                         Play music.    I hear him near.    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!                              Enter Nurse.    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:    Make haste, I say.                                                       [Exeunt.]Scene V.Juliet's chamber.[Enter Nurse.]  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.    Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!    What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,    The County Paris hath set up his rest    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!    Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?                                     [Draws aside the curtains.]    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!    O weraday that ever I was born!    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!                           Enter Mother.  Mother. What noise is here?  Nurse. O lamentable day!  Mother. What is the matter?  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!    Help, help! Call help.                            Enter Father.  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;    Life and these lips have long been separated.    Death lies on her like an untimely frost    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.  Nurse. O lamentable day!  Mother. O woful time!  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.    O son, the night before thy wedding day    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,    And doth it give me such a sight as this?  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!    Most lamentable day, most woful day    That ever ever I did yet behold!    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!    Never was seen so black a day as this.    O woful day! O woful day!  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!    O love! O life! not life, but love in death  Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now    To murther, murther our solemnity?    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,    And with my child my joys are buried!  Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,    And all the better is it for the maid.    Your part in her you could not keep from death,    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.    The most you sought was her promotion,    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?    O, in this love, you love your child so ill    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.    She's not well married that lives married long,    But she's best married that dies married young.    Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,    In all her best array bear her to church;    For though fond nature bids us all lament,    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.  Cap. All things that we ordained festival    Turn from their office to black funeral-    Our instruments to melancholy bells,    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;    And all things change them to the contrary.  Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare    To follow this fair corse unto her grave.    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;    Move them no more by crossing their high will.                           Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].  1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!    For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]  1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.                         Enter Peter.  Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'  1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is    full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.  1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.  Pet. You will not then?  1. Mus. No.  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.  1. Mus. What will you give us?  Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the     minstrel.  1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you    note me?  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.  Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an    iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,           Then music with her silver sound'-    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?    What say you, Simon Catling?  1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.  Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?  2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.  Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?  3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It    is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no    gold for sounding.           'Then music with her silver sound             With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.  1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?  2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the    mourners, and stay dinner.

       "  'Text': \"V. Scene I.Mantua. A street.Enter Romeo.  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?    How doth my lady? Is my father well?    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,    For nothing can be ill if she be well.  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,    And her immortal part with angels lives.    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault    And presently took post to tell it you.    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.    Your looks are pale and wild and do import    Some misadventure.  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?  Man. No, my good lord.  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.                                               Exit [Balthasar].    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!    I do remember an apothecary,    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves    A beggarly account of empty boxes,    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.    Noting this penury, to myself I said,    'An if a man did need a poison now    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,    And this same needy man must sell it me.    As I remember, this should be the house.    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!                        Enter Apothecary.  Apoth. Who calls so loud?  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear    As will disperse itself through all the veins    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath    As violently as hasty powder fir'd    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law    Is death to any he that utters them.  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;    The world affords no law to make thee rich;    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will    And drink it off, and if you had the strength    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.                                                         Exeunt.Scene II.Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!                      Enter Friar Laurence.  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,    One of our order, to associate me    Here in this city visiting the sick,    And finding him, the searchers of the town,    Suspecting that we both were in a house    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?  John. I could not send it- here it is again-    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,    So fearful were they of infection.  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,    Of dear import; and the neglecting it    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight    Unto my cell.  John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.    She will beshrew me much that Romeo    Hath had no notice of these accidents;    But I will write again to Mantua,    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-    Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.Scene III.Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.    The obsequies that I for thee will keep    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.                                                    Whistle Boy.    The boy gives warning something doth approach.    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,                    and a crow of iron.  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof    And do not interrupt me in my course.    Why I descend into this bed of death    Is partly to behold my lady's face,    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger    A precious ring- a ring that I must use    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry    In what I farther shall intend to do,    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.    The time and my intents are savage-wild,    More fierce and more inexorable far    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.                                           Romeo opens the tomb.  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief    It is supposed the fair creature died-    And here is come to do some villanous shame    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,    But not another sin upon my head    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,    For I come hither arm'd against myself.    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration    And apprehend thee for a felon here.  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!                                                     They fight.  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!    What said my man when my betossed soul    Did not attend him as we rode? I think    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes    This vault a feasting presence full of light.    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]    How oft when men are at the point of death    Have they been merry! which their keepers call    A lightning before death. O, how may I    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?    O, what more favour can I do to thee    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain    To sunder his that was thine enemy?    Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?    For fear of that I still will stay with thee    And never from this palace of dim night    Depart again. Here, here will I remain    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here    Will I set up my everlasting rest    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,    It burneth in the Capels' monument.  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,    One that you love.  Friar. Who is it?  Bal. Romeo.  Friar. How long hath he been there?  Bal. Full half an hour.  Friar. Go with me to the vault.  Bal. I dare not, sir.    My master knows not but I am gone hence,    And fearfully did menace me with death    If I did stay to look on his intents.  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,    I dreamt my master and another fought,    And that my master slew him.  Friar. Romeo!    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?    What mean these masterless and gory swords    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.                                                   Juliet rises.  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?    I do remember well where I should be,    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.    A greater power than we can contradict    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.                                                   Exit [Friar].    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]    Thy lips are warm!  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,    Who here hath lain this two days buried.    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,    But the true ground of all these piteous woes    We cannot without circumstance descry.     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.    We took this mattock and this spade from him    As he was coming from this churchyard side.  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,    That calls our person from our morning rest?            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,    With open outcry, toward our monument.  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,    Warm and new kill'd.  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,    With instruments upon them fit to open    These dead men's tombs.  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house    Is empty on the back of Montague,    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.               Enter Montague [and others].  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up    To see thy son and heir more early down.  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.    What further woe conspires against mine age?  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,    To press before thy father to a grave?  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,    Till we can clear these ambiguities    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;    And then will I be general of your woes    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,    And let mischance be slave to patience.    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,    Yet most suspected, as the time and place    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce    To County Paris. Then comes she to me    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean    To rid her from this second marriage,    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)    A sleeping potion; which so took effect    As I intended, for it wrought on her    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo    That he should hither come as this dire night    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,    Being the time the potion's force should cease.    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone    At the prefixed hour of her waking    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.    But when I came, some minute ere the time    Of her awaking, here untimely lay    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth    And bear this work of heaven with patience;    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.    All this I know, and to the marriage    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,    Unto the rigour of severest law.  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;    And then in post he came from Mantua    To this same place, to this same monument.    This letter he early bid me give his father,    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,    If I departed not and left him there.  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;    And by-and-by my master drew on him;    And then I ran away to call the watch.  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;    And here he writes that he did buy a poison    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!    And I, for winking at you, discords too,    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more    Can I demand.  Mon. But I can give thee more;    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,    That whiles Verona by that name is known,    There shall no figure at such rate be set    As that of true and faithful Juliet.  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;    For never was a story of more woe    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.                                                   Exeunt omnes.\"},\n",

I Madam, it is common\\\\\\\\   Queen. If it be;\\\\Why seemes it so particular with thee\\\\\\\\   Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:\\\\'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)\\\\Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,\\\\Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,\\\\No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,\\\\Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,\\\\Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,\\\\That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,\\\\For they are actions that a man might play:\\\\But I haue that Within, which passeth show;\\\\These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe\\\\\\\\   King. 'Tis sweet and commendable\\\\In your Nature Hamlet,\\\\To giue these mourning duties to your Father:\\\\But you must know, your Father lost a Father,\\\\That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound\\\\In filiall Obligation, for some terme\\\\To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer\\\\In obstinate Condolement, is a course\\\\Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,\\\\It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,\\\\A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,\\\\An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:\\\\For, what we know must be, and is as common\\\\As any the most vulgar thing to sence,\\\\Why should we in our peeuish Opposition\\\\Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,\\\\A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,\\\\To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame\\\\Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,\\\\From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,\\\\This must be so. We pray you throw to earth\\\\This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs\\\\As of a Father; For let the world take note,\\\\You are the most immediate to our Throne,\\\\And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,\\\\Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,\\\\Do I impart towards you.

Come away.\\\\\\\\Exeunt.\\\\\\\\Manet Hamlet.\\\\\\\\  Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,\\\\Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:\\\\Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt\\\\His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!\\\\How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable\\\\Seemes to me all the vses of this world?\\\\Fie on't?

Season your admiration for a while\\\\With an attent eare; till I may deliuer\\\\Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,\\\\This maruell to you\\\\\\\\   Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare\\\\\\\\   Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen\\\\(Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch\\\\In the dead wast and middle of the night\\\\Beene thus encountred.

This to me\\\\In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,\\\\And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,\\\\Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,\\\\Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,\\\\The Apparition comes.

My Lord, I did;\\\\But answere made it none: yet once me thought\\\\It lifted vp it head, and did addresse\\\\It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:\\\\But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;\\\\And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,\\\\And vanisht from our sight\\\\\\\\   Ham. Tis very strange\\\\\\\\   Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;\\\\And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty\\\\To let you know of it\\\\\\\\   Ham.

A countenance more in sorrow then in anger\\\\\\\\   Ham. Pale, or red?\\\\  Hor. Nay very pale\\\\\\\\   Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?\\\\  Hor. Most constantly\\\\\\\\   Ham. I would I had beene there\\\\\\\\   Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you\\\\\\\\   Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?\\\\  Hor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred\\\\\\\\   All.

No more\\\\\\\\   Ophel. No more but so\\\\\\\\   Laer. Thinke it no more:\\\\For nature cressant does not grow alone,\\\\In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,\\\\The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule\\\\Growes wide withall.

Then if he sayes he loues you,\\\\It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;\\\\As he in his peculiar Sect and force\\\\May giue his saying deed: which is no further,\\\\Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.\\\\Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,\\\\If with too credent eare you list his Songs;\\\\Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open\\\\To his vnmastred importunity.\\\\Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,\\\\And keepe within the reare of your Affection;\\\\Out of the shot and danger of Desire.\\\\The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,\\\\If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:\\\\Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,\\\\The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring\\\\Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,\\\\And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,\\\\Contagious blastments are most imminent.\\\\Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;\\\\Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere\\\\\\\\   Ophe. I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,\\\\As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother\\\\Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,\\\\Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;\\\\Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine\\\\Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,\\\\And reaks not his owne reade\\\\\\\\   Laer. Oh, feare me not.\\\\Enter Polonius.\\\\\\\\I stay too long; but here my Father comes:\\\\A double blessing is a double grace;\\\\Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue\\\\\\\\   Polon. Yet heere Laertes?

Came this from Hamlet to her\\\\\\\\   Pol. Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.\\\\Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,\\\\Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:\\\\Doubt Truth to be a Lier,\\\\But neuer Doubt, I loue.\\\\O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to\\\\reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best beleeue\\\\it.

But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?\\\\  Pol. What do you thinke of me?\\\\  King. As of a man, faithfull and Honourable\\\\\\\\   Pol. I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?\\\\When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,\\\\As I perceiued it, I must tell you that\\\\Before my Daughter told me what might you\\\\Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,\\\\If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,\\\\Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,\\\\Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,\\\\What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,\\\\And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake\\\\Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,\\\\This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,\\\\That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,\\\\Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:\\\\Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,\\\\And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,\\\\Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,\\\\Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,\\\\Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension\\\\Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,\\\\And all we waile for\\\\\\\\   King.

Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,\\\\That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,\\\\When it prou'd otherwise?\\\\  King. Not that I know\\\\\\\\   Pol. Take this from this; if this be otherwise,\\\\If Circumstances leade me, I will finde\\\\Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede\\\\Within the Center\\\\\\\\   King. How may we try it further?\\\\  Pol. You know sometimes\\\\He walkes foure houres together, heere\\\\In the Lobby\\\\\\\\   Qu. So he ha's indeed\\\\\\\\   Pol. At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,\\\\Be you and I behinde an Arras then,\\\\Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,\\\\And be not from his reason falne thereon;\\\\Let me be no Assistant for a State,\\\\And keepe a Farme and Carters\\\\\\\\   King.

Do you know me, my Lord?\\\\  Ham. Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger\\\\\\\\   Pol. Not I my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man\\\\\\\\   Pol. Honest, my Lord?\\\\  Ham. I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee\\\\one man pick'd out of two thousand\\\\\\\\   Pol. That's very true, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,\\\\being a good kissing Carrion-\\\\Haue you a daughter?\\\\  Pol. I haue my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a\\\\blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend\\\\looke too't\\\\\\\\   Pol. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter:\\\\yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:\\\\he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,\\\\I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile\\\\speake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?\\\\  Ham. Words, words, words\\\\\\\\   Pol. What is the matter, my Lord?\\\\  Ham. Betweene who?\\\\  Pol. I meane the matter you meane, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,\\\\that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;\\\\their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree\\\\Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,\\\\together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I\\\\most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it\\\\not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your\\\\selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could\\\\go backward\\\\\\\\   Pol. Though this be madnesse,\\\\Yet there is Method in't: will you walke\\\\Out of the ayre my Lord?\\\\  Ham. Into my Graue?\\\\  Pol. Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:\\\\How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?\\\\A happinesse,\\\\That often Madnesse hits on,\\\\Which Reason and Sanitie could not\\\\So prosperously be deliuer'd of.\\\\I will leaue him,\\\\And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting\\\\Betweene him, and my daughter.\\\\My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly\\\\Take my leaue of you\\\\\\\\   Ham. You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I\\\\will more willingly part withall, except my life, my\\\\life\\\\\\\\   Polon. Fare you well my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. These tedious old fooles\\\\\\\\   Polon. You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there\\\\hee is.\\\\Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne.\\\\\\\\  Rosin. God saue you Sir\\\\\\\\   Guild. Mine honour'd Lord?\\\\  Rosin. My most deare Lord?\\\\  Ham. My excellent good friends? How do'st thou\\\\Guildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye\\\\both?\\\\  Rosin. As the indifferent Children of the earth\\\\\\\\   Guild. Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes\\\\Cap, we are not the very Button\\\\\\\\   Ham. Nor the Soales of her Shoo?\\\\  Rosin. Neither my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle\\\\of her fauour?\\\\  Guil. Faith, her priuates, we\\\\\\\\   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:\\\\she is a Strumpet. What's the newes?\\\\  Rosin. None my Lord; but that the World's growne\\\\honest\\\\\\\\   Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is\\\\not true. Let me question more in particular: what haue\\\\you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,\\\\that she sends you to Prison hither?\\\\  Guil. Prison, my Lord?\\\\  Ham. Denmark's a Prison\\\\\\\\   Rosin. Then is the World one\\\\\\\\   Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,\\\\Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'\\\\worst\\\\\\\\   Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing\\\\either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is\\\\a prison\\\\\\\\   Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis\\\\too narrow for your minde\\\\\\\\   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and\\\\count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that\\\\I haue bad dreames\\\\\\\\   Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the\\\\very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow\\\\of a Dreame\\\\\\\\   Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow\\\\\\\\   Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and\\\\light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow\\\\\\\\   Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs\\\\and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:\\\\shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?\\\\  Both. Wee'l wait vpon you\\\\\\\\   Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the\\\\rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest\\\\man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten\\\\way of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?\\\\  Rosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion\\\\\\\\   Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;\\\\but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks\\\\are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it\\\\your owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\\\\deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake\\\\\\\\   Guil. What should we say my Lord?\\\\  Ham. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were\\\\sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;\\\\which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,\\\\I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you\\\\\\\\   Rosin. To what end my Lord?\\\\  Ham. That you must teach me: but let mee coniure\\\\you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\\\\our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,\\\\and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge\\\\you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you\\\\were sent for or no\\\\\\\\   Rosin. What say you?\\\\  Ham. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me\\\\hold not off\\\\\\\\   Guil. My Lord, we were sent for\\\\\\\\   Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\\\\preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and\\\\Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore\\\\I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;\\\\and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;\\\\that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill\\\\Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,\\\\look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,\\\\fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing\\\\to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.\\\\What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in\\\\Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing\\\\how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?\\\\in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the\\\\world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is\\\\this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,\\\\nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme\\\\to say so\\\\\\\\   Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my\\\\thoughts\\\\\\\\   Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights\\\\not me?\\\\  Rosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,\\\\what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue\\\\from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are\\\\they comming to offer you Seruice\\\\\\\\   Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; his\\\\Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous\\\\Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall\\\\not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in\\\\peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs\\\\are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde\\\\freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players\\\\are they?\\\\  Rosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight in\\\\the Tragedians of the City\\\\\\\\   Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residence\\\\both in reputation and profit was better both\\\\wayes\\\\\\\\   Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes\\\\of the late Innouation?\\\\  Ham. Doe they hold the same estimation they did\\\\when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?\\\\  Rosin. No indeed, they are not\\\\\\\\   Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?\\\\  Rosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted\\\\pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little\\\\Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and\\\\are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the\\\\fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they\\\\call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of\\\\Goose-quils, and dare scarse come thither\\\\\\\\   Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?\\\\How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no\\\\longer then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards\\\\if they should grow themselues to common Players (as\\\\it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers\\\\do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their\\\\owne Succession\\\\\\\\   Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:\\\\and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.\\\\There was for a while, no mony bid for argument,\\\\vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in\\\\the Question\\\\\\\\   Ham. Is't possible?\\\\  Guild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of\\\\Braines\\\\\\\\   Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?\\\\  Rosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too\\\\\\\\   Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of\\\\Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him\\\\while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred\\\\Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is something\\\\in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could\\\\finde it out.\\\\\\\\Flourish for the Players.\\\\\\\\  Guil. There are the Players\\\\\\\\   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your\\\\hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion\\\\and Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,\\\\lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew\\\\fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment\\\\then yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,\\\\and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd\\\\\\\\   Guil. In what my deere Lord?\\\\  Ham. I am but mad North, North-West: when the\\\\Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.\\\\Enter Polonius.\\\\\\\\  Pol. Well be with you Gentlemen\\\\\\\\   Ham. Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each\\\\eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet\\\\out of his swathing clouts\\\\\\\\   Rosin. Happily he's the second time come to them: for\\\\they say, an old man is twice a childe\\\\\\\\   Ham. I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the\\\\Players. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning\\\\'twas so indeed\\\\\\\\   Pol. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you\\\\\\\\   Ham. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.\\\\When Rossius an Actor in Rome-\\\\  Pol. The Actors are come hither my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Buzze, buzze\\\\\\\\   Pol. Vpon mine Honor\\\\\\\\   Ham. Then can each Actor on his Asse-\\\\  Polon. The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,\\\\Comedie, Historie, Pastorall:\\\\Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:\\\\Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:\\\\Scene indiuidible: or Poem\\\\vnlimited. Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus\\\\too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are\\\\the onely men\\\\\\\\   Ham. O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st\\\\thou?\\\\  Pol. What a Treasure had he, my Lord?\\\\  Ham. Why one faire Daughter, and no more,\\\\The which he loued passing well\\\\\\\\   Pol. Still on my Daughter\\\\\\\\   Ham. Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?\\\\  Polon. If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter\\\\that I loue passing well\\\\\\\\   Ham. Nay that followes not\\\\\\\\   Polon. What followes then, my Lord?\\\\  Ha. Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It\\\\came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the\\\\Pons Chanson will shew you more. For looke where my\\\\Abridgements come.\\\\Enter foure or fiue Players.\\\\\\\\Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see\\\\thee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend?\\\\Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to\\\\beard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris?\\\\Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when\\\\I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God\\\\your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd\\\\within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne\\\\to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l\\\\haue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality:\\\\come, a passionate speech\\\\\\\\   1.Play. What speech, my Lord?\\\\  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was\\\\neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I\\\\remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the\\\\Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose\\\\iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an\\\\excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe\\\\with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,\\\\there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;\\\\nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the\\\\Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One\\\\cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale\\\\to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks\\\\of Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at\\\\this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like\\\\th'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus\\\\The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes\\\\Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble\\\\When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,\\\\Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd\\\\With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote\\\\Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd\\\\With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,\\\\Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\\\\That lend a tyrannous, and damned light\\\\To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,\\\\And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,\\\\With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\\\Olde Grandsire Priam seekes\\\\\\\\   Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,\\\\and good discretion\\\\\\\\   1.Player. Anon he findes him,\\\\Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,\\\\Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles\\\\Repugnant to command: vnequall match,\\\\Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:\\\\But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,\\\\Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,\\\\Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top\\\\Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash\\\\Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword\\\\Which was declining on the Milkie head\\\\Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:\\\\So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,\\\\And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.\\\\But as we often see against some storme,\\\\A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,\\\\The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below\\\\As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder\\\\Doth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,\\\\A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,\\\\And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall\\\\On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,\\\\With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword\\\\Now falles on Priam.\\\\Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,\\\\In generall Synod take away her power:\\\\Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,\\\\And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,\\\\As low as to the Fiends\\\\\\\\   Pol. This is too long\\\\\\\\   Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee\\\\say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee\\\\sleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba\\\\\\\\   1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen\\\\\\\\   Ham. The inobled Queene?\\\\  Pol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good\\\\\\\\   1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,\\\\Threatning the flame\\\\With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,\\\\Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe\\\\About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,\\\\A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.\\\\Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,\\\\'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?\\\\But if the Gods themselues did see her then,\\\\When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\\\In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,\\\\The instant Burst of Clamour that she made\\\\(Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)\\\\Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,\\\\And passion in the Gods\\\\\\\\   Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and\\\\ha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more\\\\\\\\   Ham. 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,\\\\soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.\\\\Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are\\\\the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After\\\\your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then\\\\their ill report while you liued\\\\\\\\   Pol. My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart\\\\\\\\   Ham. Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man\\\\after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse\\\\them after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they\\\\deserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them\\\\in\\\\\\\\   Pol. Come sirs.\\\\\\\\Exit Polon.\\\\\\\\  Ham. Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.\\\\Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the\\\\murther of Gonzago?\\\\  Play. I my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for a\\\\need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which\\\\I would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not?\\\\  Play. I my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke you\\\\mock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night\\\\you are welcome to Elsonower?\\\\  Rosin. Good my Lord.\\\\\\\\Exeunt.\\\\\\\\Manet Hamlet.\\\\\\\\  Ham. I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.\\\\Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?\\\\Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,\\\\But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,\\\\Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,\\\\That from her working, all his visage warm'd;\\\\Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,\\\\A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting\\\\With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?\\\\For Hecuba?\\\\What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\\\That he should weepe for her? What would he doe,\\\\Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion\\\\That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,\\\\And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:\\\\Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,\\\\Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,\\\\The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,\\\\A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake\\\\Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,\\\\And can say nothing: No, not for a King,\\\\Vpon whose property, and most deere life,\\\\A damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward?\\\\Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse?\\\\Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?\\\\Tweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,\\\\As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?\\\\Ha? Why I should take it: for it cannot be,\\\\But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall\\\\To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,\\\\I should haue fatted all the Region Kites\\\\With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,\\\\Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!\\\\Oh Vengeance!\\\\Who? What an Asse am I? I sure, this is most braue,\\\\That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,\\\\Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,\\\\Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,\\\\And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.\\\\A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.\\\\I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,\\\\Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene,\\\\Bene strooke so to the soule, that presently\\\\They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.\\\\For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake\\\\With most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,\\\\Play something like the murder of my Father,\\\\Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,\\\\Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench\\\\I know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene\\\\May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power\\\\T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps\\\\Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,\\\\As he is very potent with such Spirits,\\\\Abuses me to damne me. Ile haue grounds\\\\More Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,\\\\Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.\\\\\\\\Exit\\\\\\\\Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,\\\\Guildenstern, and\\\\Lords.\\\\\\\\  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance\\\\Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:\\\\Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet\\\\With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy\\\\\\\\   Rosin. He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,\\\\But from what cause he will by no meanes speake\\\\\\\\   Guil. Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,\\\\But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:\\\\When we would bring him on to some Confession\\\\Of his true state\\\\\\\\   Qu. Did he receiue you well?\\\\  Rosin. Most like a Gentleman\\\\\\\\   Guild. But with much forcing of his disposition\\\\\\\\   Rosin. Niggard of question, but of our demands\\\\Most free in his reply\\\\\\\\   Qu. Did you assay him to any pastime?\\\\  Rosin. Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players\\\\We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,\\\\And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy\\\\To heare of it: They are about the Court,\\\\And (as I thinke) they haue already order\\\\This night to play before him\\\\\\\\   Pol. 'Tis most true:\\\\And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties\\\\To heare, and see the matter\\\\\\\\   King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me\\\\To heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen,\\\\Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on\\\\To these delights\\\\\\\\   Rosin. We shall my Lord.\\\\\\\\Exeunt.\\\\\\\\  King. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,\\\\For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,\\\\That he, as 'twere by accident, may there\\\\Affront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)\\\\Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene\\\\We may of their encounter frankely iudge,\\\\And gather by him, as he is behaued,\\\\If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.\\\\That thus he suffers for\\\\\\\\   Qu. I shall obey you,\\\\And for your part Ophelia, I do wish\\\\That your good Beauties be the happy cause\\\\Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues\\\\Will bring him to his wonted way againe,\\\\To both your Honors\\\\\\\\   Ophe. Madam, I wish it may\\\\\\\\   Pol. Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye\\\\We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,\\\\That shew of such an exercise may colour\\\\Your lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,\\\\'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,\\\\And pious Action, we do surge o're\\\\The diuell himselfe\\\\\\\\   King. Oh 'tis true:\\\\How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?\\\\The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art\\\\Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,\\\\Then is my deede, to my most painted word.\\\\Oh heauie burthen!\\\\  Pol. I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.\\\\\\\\Exeunt.\\\\\\\\Enter Hamlet.\\\\\\\\  Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the Question:\\\\Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer\\\\The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,\\\\Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,\\\\And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe\\\\No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end\\\\The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes\\\\That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation\\\\Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,\\\\To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,\\\\For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,\\\\When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,\\\\Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect\\\\That makes Calamity of so long life:\\\\For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,\\\\The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,\\\\The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,\\\\The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes\\\\That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,\\\\When he himselfe might his Quietus make\\\\With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare\\\\To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,\\\\But that the dread of something after death,\\\\The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne\\\\No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,\\\\And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,\\\\Then flye to others that we know not of.\\\\Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,\\\\And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution\\\\Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,\\\\And enterprizes of great pith and moment,\\\\With this regard their Currants turne away,\\\\And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,\\\\The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons\\\\Be all my sinnes remembred\\\\\\\\   Ophe. Good my Lord,\\\\How does your Honor for this many a day?\\\\  Ham. I humbly thanke you: well, well, well\\\\\\\\   Ophe. My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,\\\\That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.\\\\I pray you now, receiue them\\\\\\\\   Ham.

Ha, ha: Are you honest?\\\\  Ophe. My Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Are you faire?\\\\  Ophe. What meanes your Lordship?\\\\  Ham. That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty\\\\should admit no discourse to your Beautie\\\\\\\\   Ophe. Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce\\\\then your Honestie?\\\\  Ham. I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner\\\\transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the\\\\force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.\\\\This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it\\\\proofe. I did loue you once\\\\\\\\   Ophe. Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so\\\\\\\\   Ham. You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue\\\\cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish\\\\of it. I loued you not\\\\\\\\   Ophe. I was the more deceiued\\\\\\\\   Ham. Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou\\\\be a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,\\\\but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better\\\\my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,\\\\Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,\\\\then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue\\\\them shape, or time to acte them in. What should such\\\\Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.\\\\We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy\\\\wayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?\\\\  Ophe. At home, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may\\\\play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell\\\\\\\\   Ophe. O helpe him, you sweet Heauens\\\\\\\\   Ham. If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague\\\\for thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,\\\\thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.\\\\Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:\\\\for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you\\\\make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell\\\\\\\\   Ophe. O heauenly Powers, restore him\\\\\\\\   Ham. I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.\\\\God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:\\\\you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname\\\\Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.\\\\Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.\\\\I say, we will haue no more Marriages.

His affections do not that way tend,\\\\Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,\\\\Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?\\\\O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,\\\\And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose\\\\Will be some danger, which to preuent\\\\I haue in quicke determination\\\\Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England\\\\For the demand of our neglected Tribute:\\\\Haply the Seas and Countries different\\\\With variable Obiects, shall expell\\\\This something setled matter in his heart:\\\\Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus\\\\From fashion of himselfe.

How now Ophelia?\\\\You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,\\\\We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,\\\\But if you hold it fit after the Play,\\\\Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him\\\\To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,\\\\And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare\\\\Of all their Conference.

Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd\\\\it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,\\\\as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer\\\\had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much\\\\your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,\\\\Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of\\\\Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that\\\\may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule,\\\\to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion\\\\to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the\\\\Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of\\\\nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could\\\\haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it\\\\outHerod's Herod. Pray you auoid it\\\\\\\\   Player. I warrant your Honor\\\\\\\\   Ham. Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne\\\\Discretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word,\\\\the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:\\\\That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any\\\\thing so ouer-done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whose\\\\end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer\\\\the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne\\\\Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and\\\\Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this\\\\ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull\\\\laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The\\\\censure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway\\\\a whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players\\\\that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that\\\\highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing\\\\the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,\\\\or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue\\\\thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,\\\\and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably\\\\\\\\   Play. I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with\\\\vs, Sir\\\\\\\\   Ham. O reforme it altogether. And let those that\\\\play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for\\\\them. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,\\\\to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh\\\\too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question\\\\of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &\\\\shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses\\\\it.

Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer,\\\\to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him\\\\to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre\\\\more Choller\\\\\\\\   Guild. Good my Lord put your discourse into some\\\\frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre\\\\\\\\   Ham. I am tame Sir, pronounce\\\\\\\\   Guild. The Queene your Mother, in most great affliction\\\\of spirit, hath sent me to you\\\\\\\\   Ham. You are welcome\\\\\\\\   Guild. Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of\\\\the right breed.

But these cannot I command to any vtterance\\\\of hermony, I haue not the skill\\\\\\\\   Ham. Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing\\\\you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would\\\\seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart\\\\of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest\\\\Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke,\\\\excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot\\\\you make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee\\\\plaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,\\\\though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me.

So you shall:\\\\And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall.\\\\I pray you go with me.\\\\\\\\Exeunt.\\\\\\\\Enter Horatio, with an Attendant.\\\\\\\\  Hora. What are they that would speake with me?\\\\  Ser. Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you\\\\\\\\   Hor. Let them come in,\\\\I do not know from what part of the world\\\\I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.\\\\Enter Saylor.\\\\\\\\  Say. God blesse you Sir\\\\\\\\   Hor. Let him blesse thee too\\\\\\\\   Say. Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter\\\\for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was\\\\bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let\\\\to know it is.\\\\\\\\Reads the Letter.\\\\\\\\Horatio, When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these\\\\Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters\\\\for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very\\\\Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues too\\\\slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, I\\\\boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so\\\\I alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, like\\\\Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did. I am to doe\\\\a good turne for them. Let the King haue the Letters I haue\\\\sent, and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest\\\\flye death. I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee\\\\dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter.\\\\These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am. Rosincrance\\\\and Guildensterne, hold their course for England. Of them\\\\I haue much to tell thee, Farewell.\\\\He that thou knowest thine,\\\\Hamlet.\\\\Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,\\\\And do't the speedier, that you may direct me\\\\To him from whom you brought them.\\\\Enter.\\\\\\\\Enter King and Laertes.\\\\\\\\  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,\\\\And you must put me in your heart for Friend,\\\\Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,\\\\That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,\\\\Pursued my life\\\\\\\\   Laer. It well appeares. But tell me,\\\\Why you proceeded not against these feates,\\\\So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,\\\\As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,\\\\You mainly were stirr'd vp?\\\\  King. O for two speciall Reasons,\\\\Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,\\\\And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,\\\\Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,\\\\My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,\\\\She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;\\\\That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,\\\\I could not but by her. The other Motiue,\\\\Why to a publike count I might not go,\\\\Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,\\\\Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,\\\\Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,\\\\Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes\\\\Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,\\\\Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,\\\\And not where I had arm'd them\\\\\\\\   Laer. And so haue I a Noble Father lost,\\\\A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,\\\\Who was (if praises may go backe againe)\\\\Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age\\\\For her perfections. But my reuenge will come\\\\\\\\   King. Breake not your sleepes for that,\\\\You must not thinke\\\\That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,\\\\That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,\\\\And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,\\\\I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,\\\\And that I hope will teach you to imagine-\\\\Enter a Messenger.\\\\\\\\How now? What Newes?\\\\  Mes. Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your\\\\Maiesty: this to the Queene\\\\\\\\   King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?\\\\  Mes. Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:\\\\They were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them\\\\\\\\   King. Laertes you shall heare them:\\\\Leaue vs.\\\\\\\\Exit Messenger\\\\\\\\High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your\\\\Kingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly\\\\Eyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount\\\\th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.\\\\Hamlet.\\\\What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?\\\\Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?\\\\  Laer. Know you the hand?\\\\  Kin. 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript\\\\here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?\\\\  Laer. I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,\\\\It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,\\\\That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;\\\\Thus diddest thou\\\\\\\\   Kin. If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:\\\\How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?\\\\  Laer. If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace\\\\\\\\   Kin. To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,\\\\As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes\\\\No more to vndertake it; I will worke him\\\\To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,\\\\Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\\\\And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,\\\\But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,\\\\And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence\\\\Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,\\\\I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,\\\\And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant\\\\Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,\\\\And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,\\\\As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd\\\\With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,\\\\That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,\\\\Come short of what he did\\\\\\\\   Laer. A Norman was't?\\\\  Kin. A Norman\\\\\\\\   Laer. Vpon my life Lamound\\\\\\\\   Kin. The very same\\\\\\\\   Laer. I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,\\\\And Iemme of all our Nation\\\\\\\\   Kin. Hee mad confession of you,\\\\And gaue you such a Masterly report,\\\\For Art and exercise in your defence;\\\\And for your Rapier most especiall,\\\\That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,\\\\If one could match you Sir. This report of his\\\\Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,\\\\That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,\\\\Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;\\\\Now out of this\\\\\\\\   Laer. Why out of this, my Lord?\\\\  Kin. Laertes was your Father deare to you?\\\\Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,\\\\A face without a heart?\\\\  Laer. Why aske you this?\\\\  Kin. Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,\\\\But that I know Loue is begun by Time:\\\\And that I see in passages of proofe,\\\\Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:\\\\Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,\\\\To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,\\\\More then in words?\\\\  Laer. To cut his throat i'th' Church\\\\\\\\   Kin. No place indeed should murder Sancturize;\\\\Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes\\\\Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,\\\\Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:\\\\Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,\\\\And set a double varnish on the fame\\\\The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,\\\\And wager on your heads, he being remisse,\\\\Most generous, and free from all contriuing,\\\\Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,\\\\Or with a little shuffling, you may choose\\\\A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,\\\\Requit him for your Father\\\\\\\\   Laer. I will doo't.\\\\And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:\\\\I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke\\\\So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,\\\\Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,\\\\Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue\\\\Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,\\\\That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,\\\\With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,\\\\It may be death\\\\\\\\   Kin. Let's further thinke of this,\\\\Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes\\\\May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;\\\\And that our drift looke through our bad performance,\\\\'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect\\\\Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,\\\\If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see\\\\Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,\\\\I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,\\\\As make your bowts more violent to the end,\\\\And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him\\\\A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\\\\If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\\\\Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.\\\\Enter Queene.\\\\\\\\  Queen. One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,\\\\So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes\\\\\\\\   Laer. Drown'd! O where?\\\\  Queen. There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,\\\\That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:\\\\There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,\\\\Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,\\\\That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;\\\\But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:\\\\There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds\\\\Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,\\\\When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,\\\\Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,\\\\And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,\\\\Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,\\\\As one incapable of her owne distresse,\\\\Or like a creature Natiue, and indued\\\\Vnto that Element: but long it could not be,\\\\Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,\\\\Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,\\\\To muddy death\\\\\\\\   Laer. Alas then, is she drown'd?\\\\  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd\\\\\\\\   Laer. Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,\\\\And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet\\\\It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,\\\\Let shame say what it will; when these are gone\\\\The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,\\\\I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,\\\\But that this folly doubts it.\\\\Enter.\\\\\\\\  Kin. Let's follow, Gertrude:\\\\How much I had to doe to calme his rage?\\\\Now feare I this will giue it start againe;\\\\Therefore let's follow.\\\\\\\\Exeunt.\\\\\\\\Enter two Clownes.\\\\\\\\  Clown. Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that\\\\wilfully seekes her owne saluation?\\\\  Other. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue\\\\straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian\\\\buriall\\\\\\\\   Clo. How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in\\\\her owne defence?\\\\  Other. Why 'tis found so\\\\\\\\   Clo. It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for\\\\heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues\\\\an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an\\\\Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe\\\\wittingly\\\\\\\\   Other. Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer\\\\\\\\   Clown. Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:\\\\heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water\\\\and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;\\\\marke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne\\\\him; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not\\\\guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life\\\\\\\\   Other. But is this law?\\\\  Clo. I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law\\\\\\\\   Other. Will you ha the truth on't: if this had not\\\\beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried\\\\out of Christian Buriall\\\\\\\\   Clo. Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty that\\\\great folke should haue countenance in this world to\\\\drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.\\\\Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,\\\\but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vp\\\\Adams Profession\\\\\\\\   Other. Was he a Gentleman?\\\\  Clo. He was the first that euer bore Armes\\\\\\\\   Other. Why he had none\\\\\\\\   Clo. What, ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnderstand\\\\the Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd;\\\\could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another question\\\\to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confesse\\\\thy selfe-\\\\  Other. Go too\\\\\\\\   Clo. What is he that builds stronger then either the\\\\Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?\\\\  Other. The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a\\\\thousand Tenants\\\\\\\\   Clo. I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes\\\\does well; but how does it well? it does well to those\\\\that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is\\\\built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes\\\\may doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come\\\\\\\\   Other. Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,\\\\or a Carpenter?\\\\  Clo. I, tell me that, and vnyoake\\\\\\\\   Other. Marry, now I can tell\\\\\\\\   Clo. Too't\\\\\\\\   Other. Masse, I cannot tell.\\\\Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.\\\\\\\\  Clo. Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your\\\\dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when\\\\you are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: the\\\\Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee\\\\to Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.\\\\\\\\Sings.\\\\\\\\In youth when I did loue, did loue,\\\\me thought it was very sweete:\\\\To contract O the time for a my behoue,\\\\O me thought there was nothing meete\\\\\\\\   Ham. Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that\\\\he sings at Graue-making?\\\\  Hor. Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse\\\\\\\\   Ham. 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath\\\\the daintier sense\\\\\\\\   Clowne sings. But Age with his stealing steps\\\\hath caught me in his clutch:\\\\And hath shipped me intill the Land,\\\\as if I had neuer beene such\\\\\\\\   Ham. That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing\\\\once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it\\\\were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It\\\\might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:\\\\one that could circumuent God, might it not?\\\\  Hor. It might, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow\\\\sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this\\\\might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such\\\\a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?\\\\  Hor. I, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,\\\\Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons\\\\Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to\\\\see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but\\\\to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke\\\\on't\\\\\\\\   Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,\\\\for and a shrowding-Sheete:\\\\O a Pit of Clay for to be made,\\\\for such a Guest is meete\\\\\\\\   Ham. There's another: why might not that bee the\\\\Scull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his\\\\Quillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why\\\\doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about\\\\the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of\\\\his Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's\\\\time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,\\\\his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:\\\\Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,\\\\to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his\\\\Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double\\\\ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of\\\\Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will\\\\hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe\\\\haue no more? ha?\\\\  Hor. Not a iot more, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?\\\\  Hor. I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too\\\\\\\\   Ham. They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance\\\\in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's\\\\this Sir?\\\\  Clo. Mine Sir:\\\\O a Pit of Clay for to be made,\\\\for such a Guest is meete\\\\\\\\   Ham. I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't\\\\\\\\   Clo. You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:\\\\for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine\\\\\\\\   Ham. Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:\\\\'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou\\\\lyest\\\\\\\\   Clo. 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me\\\\to you\\\\\\\\   Ham. What man dost thou digge it for?\\\\  Clo. For no man Sir\\\\\\\\   Ham. What woman then?\\\\  Clo. For none neither\\\\\\\\   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?\\\\  Clo. One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,\\\\shee's dead\\\\\\\\   Ham. How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake\\\\by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the\\\\Lord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,\\\\the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant\\\\comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his\\\\Kibe. How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?\\\\  Clo. Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day\\\\that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras\\\\\\\\   Ham. How long is that since?\\\\  Clo. Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:\\\\It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee\\\\that was mad, and sent into England\\\\\\\\   Ham. I marry, why was he sent into England?\\\\  Clo. Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his\\\\wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there\\\\\\\\   Ham. Why?\\\\  Clo. 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as\\\\mad as he\\\\\\\\   Ham. How came he mad?\\\\  Clo. Very strangely they say\\\\\\\\   Ham. How strangely?\\\\  Clo. Faith e'ene with loosing his wits\\\\\\\\   Ham. Vpon what ground?\\\\  Clo. Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene\\\\heere, man and Boy thirty yeares\\\\\\\\   Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?\\\\  Clo. Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue\\\\many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold\\\\the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine\\\\yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare\\\\\\\\   Ham. Why he, more then another?\\\\  Clo. Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that\\\\he will keepe out water a great while. And your water,\\\\is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull\\\\now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years\\\\\\\\   Ham. Whose was it?\\\\  Clo. A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;\\\\Whose doe you thinke it was?\\\\  Ham. Nay, I know not\\\\\\\\   Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a\\\\Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull\\\\Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester\\\\\\\\   Ham. This?\\\\  Clo. E'ene that\\\\\\\\   Ham. Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,\\\\a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he\\\\hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how\\\\abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere\\\\hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.\\\\Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your\\\\Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to\\\\set the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own\\\\Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies\\\\Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this\\\\fauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prythee\\\\Horatio tell me one thing\\\\\\\\   Hor. What's that my Lord?\\\\  Ham. Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion\\\\i'th' earth?\\\\  Hor. E'ene so\\\\\\\\   Ham. And smelt so? Puh\\\\\\\\   Hor. E'ene so, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. To what base vses we may returne Horatio.\\\\Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,\\\\till he find it stopping a bunghole\\\\\\\\   Hor.

But to follow him thether\\\\with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.\\\\Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth\\\\into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make\\\\Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)\\\\might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?\\\\Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,\\\\Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.\\\\Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,\\\\Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.\\\\But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.\\\\Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.\\\\\\\\The Queene, the Courtiers.

Being thus benetted round with Villaines,\\\\Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,\\\\They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,\\\\Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,\\\\I once did hold it as our Statists doe,\\\\A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much\\\\How to forget that learning: but Sir now,\\\\It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know\\\\The effects of what I wrote?\\\\  Hor. I, good my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. An earnest Coniuration from the King,\\\\As England was his faithfull Tributary,\\\\As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,\\\\As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,\\\\And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,\\\\And many such like Assis of great charge,\\\\That on the view and know of these Contents,\\\\Without debatement further, more or lesse,\\\\He should the bearers put to sodaine death,\\\\Not shriuing time allowed\\\\\\\\   Hor. How was this seal'd?\\\\  Ham. Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;\\\\I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,\\\\Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:\\\\Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,\\\\Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,\\\\The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day\\\\Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,\\\\Thou know'st already\\\\\\\\   Hor. So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't\\\\\\\\   Ham. Why man, they did make loue to this imployment\\\\They are not neere my Conscience; their debate\\\\Doth by their owne insinuation grow:\\\\'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes\\\\Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points\\\\Of mighty opposites\\\\\\\\   Hor. Why, what a King is this?\\\\  Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon\\\\He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,\\\\Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,\\\\Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,\\\\And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,\\\\To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd\\\\To let this Canker of our nature come\\\\In further euill\\\\\\\\   Hor. It must be shortly knowne to him from England\\\\What is the issue of the businesse there\\\\\\\\   Ham. It will be short,\\\\The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more\\\\Then to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,\\\\That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;\\\\For by the image of my Cause, I see\\\\The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:\\\\But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me\\\\Into a Towring passion\\\\\\\\   Hor. Peace, who comes heere?\\\\Enter young Osricke.\\\\\\\\  Osr. Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke\\\\\\\\   Ham. I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?\\\\  Hor. No my good Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to\\\\know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast\\\\be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings\\\\Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession\\\\of dirt\\\\\\\\   Osr. Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,\\\\I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty\\\\\\\\   Ham. I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put\\\\your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head\\\\\\\\   Osr. I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot\\\\\\\\   Ham. No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is\\\\Northerly\\\\\\\\   Osr. It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed\\\\\\\\   Ham. Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my\\\\Complexion\\\\\\\\   Osr. Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere\\\\I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie\\\\to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:\\\\Sir, this is the matter\\\\\\\\   Ham. I beseech you remember\\\\\\\\   Osr. Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:\\\\Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at\\\\his weapon\\\\\\\\   Ham. What's his weapon?\\\\  Osr. Rapier and dagger\\\\\\\\   Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well\\\\\\\\   Osr. The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,\\\\against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French\\\\Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,\\\\Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very\\\\deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate\\\\carriages, and of very liberall conceit\\\\\\\\   Ham. What call you the Carriages?\\\\  Osr. The Carriages Sir, are the hangers\\\\\\\\   Ham. The phrase would bee more Germaine to the\\\\matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would\\\\it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses\\\\against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three\\\\liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against\\\\the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?\\\\  Osr. The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene\\\\you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;\\\\He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to\\\\imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the\\\\Answere\\\\\\\\   Ham. How if I answere no?\\\\  Osr. I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person\\\\in tryall\\\\\\\\   Ham. Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please\\\\his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let\\\\the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the\\\\King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if\\\\not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits\\\\\\\\   Osr. Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?\\\\  Ham. To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature\\\\will\\\\\\\\   Osr. I commend my duty to your Lordship\\\\\\\\   Ham. Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it\\\\himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue\\\\\\\\   Hor. This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his\\\\head\\\\\\\\   Ham. He did Complie with his Dugge before hee\\\\suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty\\\\that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of\\\\the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of\\\\yesty collection, which carries them through & through\\\\the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow\\\\them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out\\\\\\\\   Hor. You will lose this wager, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,\\\\I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the\\\\oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about\\\\my heart: but it is no matter\\\\\\\\   Hor. Nay, good my Lord\\\\\\\\   Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of\\\\gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman\\\\\\\\   Hor. If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestall\\\\their repaire hither, and say you are not fit\\\\\\\\   Ham. Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall\\\\Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not\\\\to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it\\\\be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no\\\\man ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?\\\\Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with\\\\Foyles,\\\\and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.\\\\\\\\  Kin. Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me\\\\\\\\   Ham. Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,\\\\But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.\\\\This presence knowes,\\\\And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht\\\\With sore distraction? What I haue done\\\\That might your nature honour, and exception\\\\Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:\\\\Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.\\\\If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:\\\\And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,\\\\Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:\\\\Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,\\\\Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,\\\\His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.\\\\Sir, in this Audience,\\\\Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,\\\\Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,\\\\That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,\\\\And hurt my Mother\\\\\\\\   Laer. I am satisfied in Nature,\\\\Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most\\\\To my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor\\\\I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,\\\\Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,\\\\I haue a voyce, and president of peace\\\\To keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,\\\\I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,\\\\And wil not wrong it\\\\\\\\   Ham. I do embrace it freely,\\\\And will this Brothers wager frankely play.\\\\Giue vs the Foyles: Come on\\\\\\\\   Laer. Come one for me\\\\\\\\   Ham. Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,\\\\Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,\\\\Sticke fiery off indeede\\\\\\\\   Laer. You mocke me Sir\\\\\\\\   Ham. No by this hand\\\\\\\\   King. Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,\\\\Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager\\\\\\\\   Ham. Verie well my Lord,\\\\Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side\\\\\\\\   King. I do not feare it,\\\\I haue seene you both:\\\\But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes\\\\\\\\   Laer. This is too heauy,\\\\Let me see another\\\\\\\\   Ham. This likes me well,\\\\These Foyles haue all a length.\\\\\\\\Prepare to play.\\\\\\\\  Osricke. I my good Lord\\\\\\\\   King. Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:\\\\If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,\\\\Or quit in answer of the third exchange,\\\\Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,\\\\The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,\\\\And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw\\\\Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings\\\\In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.\\\\Giue me the Cups,\\\\And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,\\\\The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,\\\\The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,\\\\Now the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin,\\\\And you the Iudges beare a wary eye\\\\\\\\   Ham. Come on sir\\\\\\\\   Laer. Come on sir.\\\\\\\\They play.\\\\\\\\  Ham. One\\\\\\\\   Laer. No\\\\\\\\   Ham. Iudgement\\\\\\\\   Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit\\\\\\\\   Laer. Well: againe\\\\\\\\   King. Stay, giue me drinke.\\\\Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,\\\\Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup,\\\\\\\\Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.\\\\\\\\  Ham. Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.\\\\Come: Another hit; what say you?\\\\  Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confesse\\\\\\\\   King. Our Sonne shall win\\\\\\\\   Qu. He's fat, and scant of breath.\\\\Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,\\\\The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet\\\\\\\\   Ham. Good Madam\\\\\\\\   King. Gertrude, do not drinke\\\\\\\\   Qu. I will my Lord;\\\\I pray you pardon me\\\\\\\\   King. It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late\\\\\\\\   Ham. I dare not drinke yet Madam,\\\\By and by\\\\\\\\   Qu. Come, let me wipe thy face\\\\\\\\   Laer. My Lord, Ile hit him now\\\\\\\\   King. I do not thinke't\\\\\\\\   Laer. And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience\\\\\\\\   Ham. Come for the third.\\\\Laertes, you but dally,\\\\I pray you passe with your best violence,\\\\I am affear'd you make a wanton of me\\\\\\\\   Laer. Say you so? Come on.\\\\\\\\Play.\\\\\\\\  Osr. Nothing neither way\\\\\\\\   Laer. Haue at you now.\\\\\\\\In scuffling they change Rapiers.\\\\\\\\  King. Part them, they are incens'd\\\\\\\\   Ham. Nay come, againe\\\\\\\\   Osr. Looke to the Queene there hoa\\\\\\\\   Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?\\\\  Osr. How is't Laertes?\\\\  Laer. Why as a Woodcocke\\\\To mine Sprindge, Osricke,\\\\I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie\\\\\\\\   Ham. How does the Queene?\\\\  King. She sounds to see them bleede\\\\\\\\   Qu. No, no, the drinke, the drinke.\\\\Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,\\\\I am poyson'd\\\\\\\\   Ham. Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.\\\\Treacherie, seeke it out\\\\\\\\   Laer. It is heere Hamlet.\\\\Hamlet, thou art slaine,\\\\No Medicine in the world can do thee good.\\\\In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;\\\\The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,\\\\Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise\\\\Hath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,\\\\Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:\\\\I can no more, the King, the King's too blame\\\\\\\\   Ham. The point envenom'd too,\\\\Then venome to thy worke.\\\\\\\\Hurts the King.\\\\\\\\  All. Treason, Treason\\\\\\\\   King. O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt\\\\\\\\   Ham. Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,\\\\Damned Dane,\\\\Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?\\\\Follow my Mother.\\\\\\\\King Dyes.\\\\\\\\  Laer. He is iustly seru'd.\\\\It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:\\\\Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;\\\\Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,\\\\Nor thine on me.\\\\\\\\Dyes.\\\\\\\\  Ham. Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.\\\\I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,\\\\You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,\\\\That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:\\\\Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death\\\\Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.\\\\But let it be: Horatio, I am dead,\\\\Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right\\\\To the vnsatisfied\\\\\\\\   Hor. Neuer beleeue it.\\\\I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:\\\\Heere's yet some Liquor left\\\\\\\\   Ham. As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.\\\\Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.\\\\Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name,\\\\(Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.\\\\If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,\\\\Absent thee from felicitie awhile,\\\\And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,\\\\To tell my Storie.\\\\\\\\March afarre off, and shout within.\\\\\\\\What warlike noyse is this?\\\\Enter Osricke.\\\\\\\\  Osr.

O I dye Horatio:\\\\The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,\\\\I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,\\\\But I do prophesie th' election lights\\\\On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,\\\\So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,\\\\Which haue solicited.

Where is this sight?\\\\  Hor. What is it ye would see;\\\\If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search\\\\\\\\   For. His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,\\\\What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.\\\\That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,\\\\So bloodily hast strooke\\\\\\\\   Amb. The sight is dismall,\\\\And our affaires from England come too late,\\\\The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,\\\\To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,\\\\That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:\\\\Where should we haue our thankes?\\\\  Hor. Not from his mouth,\\\\Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:\\\\He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.\\\\But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,\\\\You from the Polake warres, and you from England\\\\Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies\\\\High on a stage be placed to the view,\\\\And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,\\\\How these things came about. So shall you heare\\\\Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,\\\\Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters\\\\Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,\\\\And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,\\\\Falne on the Inuentors head.

I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany\\\\than\\\\     Cornwall.\\\\  Glou. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of\\\\the\\\\     kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most,\\\\for\\\\     equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make\\\\     choice of either's moiety.\\\\  Kent. Is not this your son, my lord?\\\\  Glou. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so\\\\often\\\\     blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.\\\\  Kent. I cannot conceive you.\\\\  Glou. Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew\\\\     round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere\\\\she\\\\     had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?\\\\  Kent. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so\\\\     proper.\\\\  Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder\\\\than\\\\     this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave\\\\came\\\\     something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet\\\\was\\\\     his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the\\\\     whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble\\\\gentleman,\\\\     Edmund?\\\\  Edm. [comes forward] No, my lord.\\\\  Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable\\\\     friend.\\\\  Edm. My services to your lordship.\\\\  Kent. I must love you, and sue to know you better.\\\\  Edm. Sir, I shall study deserving.\\\\  Glou. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.\\\\                                                 Sound a sennet.\\\\     The King is coming.\\\\\\\\      Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of\\\\      Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with\\\\                              Followers.\\\\\\\\  Lear. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.\\\\  Glou. I shall, my liege.\\\\                                 Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund].\\\\  Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.\\\\     Give me the map there. Know we have divided\\\\     In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent\\\\     To shake all cares and business from our age,\\\\     Conferring them on younger strengths while we\\\\     Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,\\\\     And you, our no less loving son of Albany,\\\\     We have this hour a constant will to publish\\\\     Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife\\\\     May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,\\\\     Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,\\\\     Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\\\\     And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters\\\\     (Since now we will divest us both of rule,\\\\     Interest of territory, cares of state),\\\\     Which of you shall we say doth love us most?\\\\     That we our largest bounty may extend\\\\     Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,\\\\     Our eldest-born, speak first.\\\\  Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;\\\\     Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;\\\\     Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;\\\\     No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\\\\     As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;\\\\     A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.\\\\     Beyond all manner of so much I love you.\\\\  Cor. [aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.\\\\  Lear. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,\\\\     With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,\\\\     With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\\\\     We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue\\\\     Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,\\\\     Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.\\\\  Reg. Sir, I am made\\\\     Of the selfsame metal that my sister is,\\\\     And prize me at her worth. In my true heart\\\\     I find she names my very deed of love;\\\\     Only she comes too short, that I profess\\\\     Myself an enemy to all other joys\\\\     Which the most precious square of sense possesses,\\\\     And find I am alone felicitate\\\\     In your dear Highness' love.\\\\  Cor. [aside] Then poor Cordelia!\\\\     And yet not so; since I am sure my love's\\\\     More richer than my tongue.\\\\  Lear. To thee and thine hereditary ever\\\\     Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,\\\\     No less in space, validity, and pleasure\\\\     Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,\\\\     Although the last, not least; to whose young love\\\\     The vines of France and milk of Burgundy\\\\     Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw\\\\     A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\\\\  Cor. Nothing, my lord.\\\\  Lear. Nothing?\\\\  Cor. Nothing.\\\\  Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.\\\\  Cor. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave\\\\     My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty\\\\     According to my bond; no more nor less.\\\\  Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,\\\\     Lest it may mar your fortunes.\\\\  Cor. Good my lord,\\\\     You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I\\\\     Return those duties back as are right fit,\\\\     Obey you, love you, and most honour you.\\\\     Why have my sisters husbands, if they say\\\\     They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,\\\\     That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry\\\\     Half my love with him, half my care and duty.\\\\     Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,\\\\     To love my father all.\\\\  Lear. But goes thy heart with this?\\\\  Cor. Ay, good my lord.\\\\  Lear. So young, and so untender?\\\\  Cor. So young, my lord, and true.\\\\  Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!\\\\     For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,\\\\     The mysteries of Hecate and the night;\\\\     By all the operation of the orbs\\\\     From whom we do exist and cease to be;\\\\     Here I disclaim all my paternal care,\\\\     Propinquity and property of blood,\\\\     And as a stranger to my heart and me\\\\     Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,\\\\     Or he that makes his generation messes\\\\     To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\\\\     Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,\\\\     As thou my sometime daughter.\\\\  Kent. Good my liege-\\\\  Lear. Peace, Kent!\\\\     Come not between the dragon and his wrath.\\\\     I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest\\\\     On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-\\\\     So be my grave my peace as here I give\\\\     Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?\\\\     Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,\\\\     With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;\\\\     Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\\\\     I do invest you jointly in my power,\\\\     Preeminence, and all the large effects\\\\     That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,\\\\     With reservation of an hundred knights,\\\\     By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode\\\\     Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain\\\\     The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,\\\\     Revenue, execution of the rest,\\\\     Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,\\\\     This coronet part betwixt you.\\\\  Kent. Royal Lear,\\\\     Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,\\\\     Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,\\\\     As my great patron thought on in my prayers-\\\\  Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.\\\\  Kent. Let it fall rather, though the fork invade\\\\     The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly\\\\     When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?\\\\     Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak\\\\     When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound\\\\     When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;\\\\     And in thy best consideration check\\\\     This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,\\\\     Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,\\\\     Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound\\\\     Reverbs no hollowness.\\\\  Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more!\\\\  Kent. My life I never held but as a pawn\\\\     To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,\\\\     Thy safety being the motive.\\\\  Lear. Out of my sight!\\\\  Kent. See better, Lear, and let me still remain\\\\     The true blank of thine eye.\\\\  Lear. Now by Apollo-\\\\  Kent. Now by Apollo, King,\\\\     Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.\\\\  Lear. O vassal! miscreant!\\\\                                   [Lays his hand on his sword.]\\\\  Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear!\\\\  Kent. Do!\\\\     Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow\\\\     Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,\\\\     Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,\\\\     I'll tell thee thou dost evil.\\\\  Lear. Hear me, recreant!\\\\     On thine allegiance, hear me!\\\\     Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-\\\\     Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride\\\\     To come between our sentence and our power,-\\\\     Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-\\\\     Our potency made good, take thy reward.\\\\     Five days we do allot thee for provision\\\\     To shield thee from diseases of the world,\\\\     And on the sixth to turn thy hated back\\\\     Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,\\\\     Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,\\\\     The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,\\\\     This shall not be revok'd.\\\\  Kent. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,\\\\     Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\\\\     [To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee,\\\\maid,\\\\     That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!\\\\     [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your\\\\deeds\\\\        approve,\\\\     That good effects may spring from words of love.\\\\     Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;\\\\     He'll shape his old course in a country new.\\\\Exit.\\\\\\\\  Flourish. Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy;\\\\Attendants.\\\\\\\\  Glou. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\\\\  Lear. My Lord of Burgundy,\\\\     We first address toward you, who with this king\\\\     Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least\\\\     Will you require in present dower with her,\\\\     Or cease your quest of love?\\\\  Bur. Most royal Majesty,\\\\     I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,\\\\     Nor will you tender less.\\\\  Lear. Right noble Burgundy,\\\\     When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;\\\\     But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.\\\\     If aught within that little seeming substance,\\\\     Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,\\\\     And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,\\\\     She's there, and she is yours.\\\\  Bur. I know no answer.\\\\  Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,\\\\     Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,\\\\     Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,\\\\     Take her, or leave her?\\\\  Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.\\\\     Election makes not up on such conditions.\\\\  Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,\\\\     I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,\\\\     I would not from your love make such a stray\\\\     To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you\\\\     T' avert your liking a more worthier way\\\\     Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd\\\\     Almost t' acknowledge hers.\\\\  France. This is most strange,\\\\     That she that even but now was your best object,\\\\     The argument of your praise, balm of your age,\\\\     Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time\\\\     Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle\\\\     So many folds of favour. Sure her offence\\\\     Must be of such unnatural degree\\\\     That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection\\\\     Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her\\\\     Must be a faith that reason without miracle\\\\     Should never plant in me.\\\\  Cor. I yet beseech your Majesty,\\\\     If for I want that glib and oily art\\\\     To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,\\\\     I'll do't before I speak- that you make known\\\\     It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,\\\\     No unchaste action or dishonoured step,\\\\     That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;\\\\     But even for want of that for which I am richer-\\\\     A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue\\\\     As I am glad I have not, though not to have it\\\\     Hath lost me in your liking.\\\\  Lear. Better thou\\\\     Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.\\\\  France. Is it but this- a tardiness in nature\\\\     Which often leaves the history unspoke\\\\     That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,\\\\     What say you to the lady? Love's not love\\\\     When it is mingled with regards that stands\\\\     Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?\\\\     She is herself a dowry.\\\\  Bur. Royal Lear,\\\\     Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,\\\\     And here I take Cordelia by the hand,\\\\     Duchess of Burgundy.\\\\  Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.\\\\  Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father\\\\     That you must lose a husband.\\\\  Cor. Peace be with Burgundy!\\\\     Since that respects of fortune are his love,\\\\     I shall not be his wife.\\\\  France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\\\\     Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!\\\\     Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.\\\\     Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.\\\\     Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect\\\\     My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.\\\\     Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,\\\\     Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.\\\\     Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy\\\\     Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.\\\\     Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.\\\\     Thou losest here, a better where to find.\\\\  Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we\\\\     Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see\\\\     That face of hers again. Therefore be gone\\\\     Without our grace, our love, our benison.\\\\     Come, noble Burgundy.\\\\             Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany,\\\\                                    Gloucester, and Attendants].\\\\  France. Bid farewell to your sisters.\\\\  Cor. The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes\\\\     Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;\\\\     And, like a sister, am most loath to call\\\\     Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.\\\\     To your professed bosoms I commit him;\\\\     But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\\\\     I would prefer him to a better place!\\\\     So farewell to you both.\\\\  Gon. Prescribe not us our duties.\\\\  Reg. Let your study\\\\     Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you\\\\     At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,\\\\     And well are worth the want that you have wanted.\\\\  Cor. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.\\\\     Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.\\\\     Well may you prosper!\\\\  France. Come, my fair Cordelia.\\\\                                     Exeunt France and Cordelia.\\\\  Gon. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly\\\\     appertains to us both. I think our father will hence\\\\to-night.\\\\  Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.\\\\  Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we\\\\     have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our\\\\     sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast\\\\her\\\\     off appears too grossly.\\\\  Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but\\\\slenderly\\\\     known himself.\\\\  Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then\\\\     must we look to receive from his age, not alone the\\\\     imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal\\\\     the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring\\\\with\\\\     them.\\\\  Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as\\\\this\\\\     of Kent's banishment.\\\\  Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France\\\\and\\\\     him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry\\\\authority\\\\     with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of\\\\his\\\\     will but offend us.\\\\  Reg. We shall further think on't.\\\\  Gon. We must do something, and i' th' heat.\\\\                                                         Exeunt.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene II.\\\\The Earl of Gloucester's Castle.\\\\\\\\Enter [Edmund the] Bastard solus, [with a letter].\\\\\\\\  Edm. Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law\\\\     My services are bound. Wherefore should I\\\\     Stand in the plague of custom, and permit\\\\     The curiosity of nations to deprive me,\\\\     For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines\\\\     Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?\\\\     When my dimensions are as well compact,\\\\     My mind as generous, and my shape as true,\\\\     As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us\\\\     With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?\\\\     Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\\\\     More composition and fierce quality\\\\     Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,\\\\     Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops\\\\     Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,\\\\     Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.\\\\     Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund\\\\     As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'!\\\\     Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,\\\\     And my invention thrive, Edmund the base\\\\     Shall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper.\\\\     Now, gods, stand up for bastards!\\\\\\\\                          Enter Gloucester.\\\\\\\\  Glou. Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted?\\\\     And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?\\\\     Confin'd to exhibition? All this done\\\\     Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?\\\\  Edm. So please your lordship, none.\\\\                                           [Puts up the letter.]\\\\  Glou. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\\\\  Edm. I know no news, my lord.\\\\  Glou. What paper were you reading?\\\\  Edm. Nothing, my lord.\\\\  Glou. No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into\\\\your\\\\     pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide\\\\     itself. Let's see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need\\\\     spectacles.\\\\  Edm. I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my\\\\brother\\\\     that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have\\\\     perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.\\\\  Glou. Give me the letter, sir.\\\\  Edm. I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents,\\\\as\\\\     in part I understand them, are to blame.\\\\  Glou. Let's see, let's see!\\\\  Edm. I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but\\\\as\\\\     an essay or taste of my virtue.\\\\\\\\  Glou. (reads) 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world\\\\     bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us\\\\     till our oldness cannot relish them.

If our father would sleep till I\\\\     wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and\\\\live\\\\     the beloved of your brother,\\\\                                                        'EDGAR.'\\\\\\\\     Hum!

Who brought\\\\it?\\\\  Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it.\\\\I\\\\     found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.\\\\  Glou. You know the character to be your brother's?\\\\  Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were\\\\his;\\\\     but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.\\\\  Glou. It is his.\\\\  Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in\\\\the\\\\     contents.\\\\  Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business?\\\\  Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be\\\\fit\\\\     that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father\\\\     should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his\\\\revenue.\\\\  Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!\\\\Abhorred\\\\     villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than\\\\     brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him.\\\\Abominable\\\\     villain! Where is he?\\\\  Edm. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to\\\\suspend\\\\     your indignation against my brother till you can derive from\\\\him\\\\     better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain\\\\course;\\\\     where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his\\\\     purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and\\\\shake\\\\     in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my\\\\life\\\\     for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your\\\\     honour, and to no other pretence of danger.\\\\  Glou. Think you so?\\\\  Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you\\\\shall\\\\     hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have\\\\your\\\\     satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this\\\\very\\\\     evening.\\\\  Glou. He cannot be such a monster.\\\\  Edm. Nor is not, sure.\\\\  Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.\\\\     Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I\\\\pray\\\\     you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would\\\\unstate\\\\     myself to be in a due resolution.\\\\  Edm. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I\\\\     shall find means, and acquaint you withal.\\\\  Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good\\\\to\\\\     us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus,\\\\yet\\\\     nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love\\\\cools,\\\\     friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies;\\\\in\\\\     countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond\\\\crack'd\\\\     'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the\\\\     prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from\\\\bias\\\\     of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the\\\\best\\\\     of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all\\\\     ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find\\\\out\\\\     this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it\\\\     carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his\\\\     offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.                       Exit.\\\\  Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we\\\\are\\\\     sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we\\\\make\\\\     guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as\\\\if\\\\     we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;\\\\     knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;\\\\     drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of\\\\     planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a\\\\divine\\\\     thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to\\\\lay\\\\     his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father\\\\     compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my\\\\     nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough\\\\and\\\\     lecherous. Fut!

I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other\\\\day,\\\\     what should follow these eclipses.\\\\  Edg. Do you busy yourself with that?\\\\  Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily:\\\\as\\\\     of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,\\\\     dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,\\\\     menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless\\\\     diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,\\\\     nuptial breaches, and I know not what.\\\\  Edg. How long have you been a sectary astronomical?\\\\  Edm. Come, come! When saw you my father last?\\\\  Edg. The night gone by.\\\\  Edm. Spake you with him?\\\\  Edg. Ay, two hours together.\\\\  Edm. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him\\\\by\\\\     word or countenance\\\\  Edg. None at all.\\\\  Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at\\\\my\\\\     entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath\\\\     qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant\\\\so\\\\     rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would\\\\     scarcely allay.\\\\  Edg. Some villain hath done me wrong.\\\\  Edm. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance\\\\till\\\\     the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire\\\\with me\\\\     to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my\\\\     lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir\\\\abroad,\\\\     go arm'd.\\\\  Edg. Arm'd, brother?\\\\  Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no\\\\honest man\\\\     if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you\\\\what I\\\\     have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and\\\\     horror of it. Pray you, away!\\\\  Edg. Shall I hear from you anon?\\\\  Edm. I do serve you in this business.\\\\                                                     Exit Edgar.\\\\     A credulous father! and a brother noble,\\\\     Whose nature is so far from doing harms\\\\     That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty\\\\     My practices ride easy!

Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?\\\\  Osw. Ay, madam.\\\\  Gon. By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour\\\\     He flashes into one gross crime or other\\\\     That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.\\\\     His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us\\\\     On every trifle.

What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?\\\\  Kent. I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him\\\\truly\\\\     that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to\\\\     converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear\\\\     judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.\\\\  Lear. What art thou?\\\\  Kent. A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King.\\\\  Lear. If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king,\\\\thou\\\\     art poor enough. What wouldst thou?\\\\  Kent. Service.\\\\  Lear. Who wouldst thou serve?\\\\  Kent. You.\\\\  Lear. Dost thou know me, fellow?\\\\  Kent. No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I\\\\would\\\\     fain call master.\\\\  Lear. What's that?\\\\  Kent. Authority.\\\\  Lear. What services canst thou do?\\\\  Kent. I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale\\\\in\\\\     telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which\\\\     ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of\\\\me\\\\     is diligence.\\\\  Lear. How old art thou?\\\\  Kent. Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so\\\\old to\\\\     dote on her for anything. I have years on my back\\\\forty-eight.\\\\  Lear. Follow me; thou shalt serve me.

Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?\\\\  Knight. Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would\\\\not.\\\\  Lear. He would not?\\\\  Knight. My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my\\\\judgment\\\\     your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious\\\\affection\\\\     as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness\\\\appears\\\\     as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself\\\\also\\\\     and your daughter.\\\\  Lear. Ha! say'st thou so?\\\\  Knight. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for\\\\     my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.\\\\  Lear. Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have\\\\     perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather\\\\     blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence\\\\     and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But\\\\     where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.\\\\  Knight. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool\\\\     hath much pined away.\\\\  Lear. No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my\\\\     daughter I would speak with her.

Why, this fellow hath banish'd two\\\\on's\\\\     daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If\\\\     thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,\\\\     nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!\\\\  Lear. Why, my boy?\\\\  Fool. If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs\\\\myself.\\\\     There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.\\\\  Lear. Take heed, sirrah- the whip.\\\\  Fool. Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out,\\\\when\\\\     Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink.\\\\  Lear. A pestilent gall to me!\\\\  Fool. Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.\\\\  Lear. Do.\\\\  Fool. Mark it, nuncle.\\\\          Have more than thou showest,\\\\          Speak less than thou knowest,\\\\          Lend less than thou owest,\\\\          Ride more than thou goest,\\\\          Learn more than thou trowest,\\\\          Set less than thou throwest;\\\\          Leave thy drink and thy whore,\\\\          And keep in-a-door,\\\\          And thou shalt have more\\\\          Than two tens to a score.\\\\  Kent. This is nothing, fool.\\\\  Fool. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave\\\\me\\\\     nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?\\\\  Lear. Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.\\\\  Fool. [to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land\\\\     comes to. He will not believe a fool.\\\\  Lear. A bitter fool!\\\\  Fool. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter\\\\     fool and a sweet fool?\\\\  Lear. No, lad; teach me.\\\\  Fool.   That lord that counsell'd thee\\\\            To give away thy land,\\\\          Come place him here by me-\\\\            Do thou for him stand.\\\\          The sweet and bitter fool\\\\            Will presently appear;\\\\          The one in motley here,\\\\            The other found out there.\\\\  Lear. Dost thou call me fool, boy?\\\\  Fool. All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast\\\\     born with.\\\\  Kent. This is not altogether fool, my lord.\\\\  Fool. No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had\\\\a\\\\     monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too,\\\\they\\\\     will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be\\\\     snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two\\\\     crowns.\\\\  Lear. What two crowns shall they be?\\\\  Fool. Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up\\\\the\\\\     meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown\\\\i'\\\\     th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass\\\\on\\\\     thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald\\\\crown\\\\     when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself\\\\in\\\\     this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.\\\\\\\\     [Sings]    Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,\\\\                  For wise men are grown foppish;\\\\                They know not how their wits to wear,\\\\                  Their manners are so apish.\\\\\\\\  Lear. When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?\\\\  Fool. I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy\\\\daughters\\\\     thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st\\\\down\\\\     thine own breeches,\\\\\\\\     [Sings]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,\\\\                  And I for sorrow sung,\\\\                That such a king should play bo-peep\\\\                  And go the fools among.\\\\\\\\     Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool\\\\to\\\\     lie. I would fain learn to lie.\\\\  Lear. An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.\\\\  Fool. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll\\\\have me\\\\     whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for\\\\lying;\\\\     and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had\\\\rather be\\\\     any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,\\\\     nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left\\\\nothing\\\\     i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.\\\\\\\\                            Enter Goneril.\\\\\\\\  Lear. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks\\\\you\\\\     are too much o' late i' th' frown.\\\\  Fool. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care\\\\for\\\\     her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am\\\\better\\\\     than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.\\\\     [To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your\\\\face\\\\     bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum!\\\\\\\\            He that keeps nor crust nor crum,\\\\            Weary of all, shall want some.-\\\\\\\\     [Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod.\\\\  Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,\\\\     But other of your insolent retinue\\\\     Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth\\\\     In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,\\\\     I had thought, by making this well known unto you,\\\\     To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,\\\\     By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,\\\\     That you protect this course, and put it on\\\\     By your allowance; which if you should, the fault\\\\     Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,\\\\     Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,\\\\     Might in their working do you that offence\\\\     Which else were shame, that then necessity\\\\     Must call discreet proceeding.\\\\  Fool. For you know, nuncle,\\\\\\\\          The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long\\\\          That it had it head bit off by it young.\\\\\\\\     So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.\\\\  Lear. Are you our daughter?\\\\  Gon. Come, sir,\\\\     I would you would make use of that good wisdom\\\\     Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away\\\\     These dispositions that of late transform you\\\\     From what you rightly are.\\\\  Fool. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?\\\\     Whoop, Jug, I love thee!\\\\  Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.\\\\     Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?\\\\     Either his notion weakens, his discernings\\\\     Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!\\\\     Who is it that can tell me who I am?\\\\  Fool. Lear's shadow.\\\\  Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,\\\\     Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded\\\\     I had daughters.\\\\  Fool. Which they will make an obedient father.\\\\  Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman?\\\\  Gon. This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour\\\\     Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you\\\\     To understand my purposes aright.\\\\     As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.\\\\     Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;\\\\     Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold\\\\     That this our court, infected with their manners,\\\\     Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust\\\\     Make it more like a tavern or a brothel\\\\     Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak\\\\     For instant remedy. Be then desir'd\\\\     By her that else will take the thing she begs\\\\     A little to disquantity your train,\\\\     And the remainder that shall still depend\\\\     To be such men as may besort your age,\\\\     Which know themselves, and you.\\\\  Lear. Darkness and devils!\\\\     Saddle my horses! Call my train together!\\\\     Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;\\\\     Yet have I left a daughter.\\\\  Gon. You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble\\\\     Make servants of their betters.\\\\\\\\                            Enter Albany.\\\\\\\\  Lear. Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?\\\\     Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.\\\\     Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,\\\\     More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child\\\\     Than the sea-monster!\\\\  Alb. Pray, sir, be patient.\\\\  Lear. [to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!\\\\     My train are men of choice and rarest parts,\\\\     That all particulars of duty know\\\\     And in the most exact regard support\\\\     The worships of their name.- O most small fault,\\\\     How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!\\\\     Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature\\\\     From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love\\\\     And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!\\\\     Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Strikes his head.]\\\\     And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.\\\\  Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant\\\\     Of what hath mov'd you.\\\\  Lear. It may be so, my lord.\\\\     Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!\\\\     Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend\\\\     To make this creature fruitful.\\\\     Into her womb convey sterility;\\\\     Dry up in her the organs of increase;\\\\     And from her derogate body never spring\\\\     A babe to honour her! If she must teem,\\\\     Create her child of spleen, that it may live\\\\     And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.\\\\     Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,\\\\     With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,\\\\     Turn all her mother's pains and benefits\\\\     To laughter and contempt, that she may feel\\\\     How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is\\\\     To have a thankless child! Away, away!                Exit.\\\\  Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?\\\\  Gon. Never afflict yourself to know the cause;\\\\     But let his disposition have that scope\\\\     That dotage gives it.\\\\\\\\                             Enter Lear.\\\\\\\\  Lear. What, fifty of my followers at a clap?\\\\     Within a fortnight?\\\\  Alb. What's the matter, sir?\\\\  Lear. I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd\\\\     That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;\\\\     That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,\\\\     Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!\\\\     Th' untented woundings of a father's curse\\\\     Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,\\\\     Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,\\\\     And cast you, with the waters that you lose,\\\\     To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?\\\\     Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,\\\\     Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.\\\\     When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails\\\\     She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find\\\\     That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think\\\\     I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.\\\\                            Exeunt [Lear, Kent, and Attendants].\\\\  Gon. Do you mark that, my lord?\\\\  Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,\\\\     To the great love I bear you -\\\\  Gon. Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!\\\\     [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your\\\\master!\\\\  Fool. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.\\\\\\\\\\\\          A fox when one has caught her,\\\\          And such a daughter,\\\\          Should sure to the slaughter,\\\\          If my cap would buy a halter.\\\\          So the fool follows after.                       Exit.\\\\  Gon. This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?\\\\     'Tis politic and safe to let him keep\\\\     At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,\\\\     Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,\\\\     He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs\\\\     And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!\\\\  Alb. Well, you may fear too far.\\\\  Gon. Safer than trust too far.\\\\     Let me still take away the harms I fear,\\\\     Not fear still to be taken.

Yes, madam.\\\\  Gon. Take you some company, and away to horse!\\\\     Inform her full of my particular fear,\\\\     And thereto add such reasons of your own\\\\     As may compact it more.

I have been with your father, and given him\\\\     notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will\\\\be\\\\     here with him this night.\\\\  Edm. How comes that?\\\\  Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean\\\\the\\\\     whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?\\\\  Edm. Not I. Pray you, what are they?\\\\  Cur. Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two\\\\Dukes\\\\     of Cornwall and Albany?\\\\  Edm. Not a word.\\\\  Cur. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.      Exit.\\\\  Edm. The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!\\\\     This weaves itself perforce into my business.\\\\     My father hath set guard to take my brother;\\\\     And I have one thing, of a queasy question,\\\\     Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!\\\\     Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!\\\\\\\\                             Enter Edgar.\\\\\\\\     My father watches. O sir, fly this place!\\\\     Intelligence is given where you are hid.\\\\     You have now the good advantage of the night.\\\\     Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?\\\\     He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,\\\\     And Regan with him. Have you nothing said\\\\     Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?\\\\     Advise yourself.\\\\  Edg. I am sure on't, not a word.\\\\  Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me!\\\\     In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.\\\\     Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-\\\\     Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!\\\\     Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.\\\\                                                     Exit Edgar.\\\\     Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion\\\\     Of my more fierce endeavour.

No help?\\\\\\\\             Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.\\\\\\\\  Glou. Now, Edmund, where's the villain?\\\\  Edm. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,\\\\     Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon\\\\     To stand 's auspicious mistress.\\\\  Glou. But where is he?\\\\  Edm. Look, sir, I bleed.\\\\  Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund?\\\\  Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-\\\\  Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after.        [Exeunt some Servants].\\\\     By no means what?\\\\  Edm. Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;\\\\     But that I told him the revenging gods\\\\     'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;\\\\     Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond\\\\     The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,\\\\     Seeing how loathly opposite I stood\\\\     To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion\\\\     With his prepared sword he charges home\\\\     My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;\\\\     But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,\\\\     Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,\\\\     Or whether gasted by the noise I made,\\\\     Full suddenly he fled.\\\\  Glou. Let him fly far.\\\\     Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;\\\\     And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,\\\\     My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.\\\\     By his authority I will proclaim it\\\\     That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,\\\\     Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;\\\\     He that conceals him, death.\\\\  Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intent\\\\     And found him pight to do it, with curst speech\\\\     I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,\\\\     'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,\\\\     If I would stand against thee, would the reposal\\\\     Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee\\\\     Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny\\\\     (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce\\\\     My very character), I'ld turn it all\\\\     To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;\\\\     And thou must make a dullard of the world,\\\\     If they not thought the profits of my death\\\\     Were very pregnant and potential spurs\\\\     To make thee seek it.'\\\\  Glou.

I know not why he comes.\\\\     All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;\\\\     The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture\\\\     I will send far and near, that all the kingdom\\\\     May have due note of him, and of my land,\\\\     Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means\\\\     To make thee capable.\\\\\\\\                Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.\\\\\\\\  Corn. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither\\\\     (Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news.\\\\  Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short\\\\     Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?\\\\  Glou. O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!\\\\  Reg. What, did my father's godson seek your life?\\\\     He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?\\\\  Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!\\\\  Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights\\\\     That tend upon my father?\\\\  Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!\\\\  Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.\\\\  Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.\\\\     'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,\\\\     To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.\\\\     I have this present evening from my sister\\\\     Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions\\\\     That, if they come to sojourn at my house,\\\\     I'll not be there.\\\\  Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan.\\\\     Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father\\\\     A childlike office.\\\\  Edm. 'Twas my duty, sir.\\\\  Glou. He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd\\\\     This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.\\\\  Corn. Is he pursued?\\\\  Glou. Ay, my good lord.\\\\  Corn. If he be taken, he shall never more\\\\     Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,\\\\     How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,\\\\     Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant\\\\     So much commend itself, you shall be ours.\\\\     Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;\\\\     You we first seize on.\\\\  Edm.

A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base,\\\\proud,\\\\     shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,\\\\     worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking,\\\\whoreson,\\\\     glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;\\\\     one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in\\\\way of\\\\     good service, and art nothing but the composition of a\\\\knave,\\\\     beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel\\\\bitch;\\\\     one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny\\\\the\\\\     least syllable of thy addition.\\\\  Osw. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one\\\\     that's neither known of thee nor knows thee!\\\\  Kent. What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest\\\\me!\\\\     Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy\\\\heels\\\\     before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for,\\\\though\\\\     it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th'\\\\     moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger!\\\\     draw!\\\\  Osw. Away! I have nothing to do with thee.\\\\  Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King,\\\\and\\\\     take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her\\\\father.\\\\     Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you\\\\     rascal! Come your ways!\\\\  Osw. Help, ho! murther! help!\\\\  Kent. Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!\\\\     Strike!                                        [Beats him.]\\\\  Osw. Help, ho! murther! murther!\\\\\\\\      Enter Edmund, with his rapier drawn, Gloucester, Cornwall,\\\\                           Regan, Servants.\\\\\\\\  Edm. How now? What's the matter?                 Parts [them].\\\\  Kent. With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh\\\\ye!\\\\     Come on, young master!\\\\  Glou. Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?\\\\  Corn. Keep peace, upon your lives!\\\\     He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?\\\\  Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King\\\\  Corn. What is your difference? Speak.\\\\  Osw. I am scarce in breath, my lord.\\\\  Kent. No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You\\\\cowardly\\\\     rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.\\\\  Corn. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?\\\\  Kent. Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not\\\\have\\\\     made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the\\\\trade.\\\\  Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?\\\\  Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd\\\\     At suit of his grey beard-\\\\  Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if\\\\     you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain\\\\into\\\\     mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my\\\\grey\\\\     beard,' you wagtail?\\\\  Corn. Peace, sirrah!\\\\     You beastly knave, know you no reverence?\\\\  Kent. Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.\\\\  Corn. Why art thou angry?\\\\  Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword,\\\\     Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,\\\\     Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain\\\\     Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion\\\\     That in the natures of their lords rebel,\\\\     Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;\\\\     Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks\\\\     With every gale and vary of their masters,\\\\     Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.\\\\     A plague upon your epileptic visage!\\\\     Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?\\\\     Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,\\\\     I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.\\\\  Corn. What, art thou mad, old fellow?\\\\  Glou. How fell you out? Say that.\\\\  Kent. No contraries hold more antipathy\\\\     Than I and such a knave.\\\\  Corn. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?\\\\  Kent. His countenance likes me not.\\\\  Corn. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.\\\\  Kent. Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.\\\\     I have seen better faces in my time\\\\     Than stands on any shoulder that I see\\\\     Before me at this instant.\\\\  Corn. This is some fellow\\\\     Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect\\\\     A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb\\\\     Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!\\\\     An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!\\\\     An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.\\\\     These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness\\\\     Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends\\\\     Than twenty silly-ducking observants\\\\     That stretch their duties nicely.\\\\  Kent. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,\\\\     Under th' allowance of your great aspect,\\\\     Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire\\\\     On flickering Phoebus' front-\\\\  Corn. What mean'st by this?\\\\  Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I\\\\     know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a\\\\plain\\\\     accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,\\\\     though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.\\\\  Corn. What was th' offence you gave him?\\\\  Osw. I never gave him any.\\\\     It pleas'd the King his master very late\\\\     To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\\\\     When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,\\\\     Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd\\\\     And put upon him such a deal of man\\\\     That worthied him, got praises of the King\\\\     For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;\\\\     And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\\\\     Drew on me here again.\\\\  Kent. None of these rogues and cowards\\\\     But Ajax is their fool.\\\\  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks!\\\\     You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,\\\\     We'll teach you-\\\\  Kent. Sir, I am too old to learn.\\\\     Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;\\\\     On whose employment I was sent to you.\\\\     You shall do small respect, show too bold malice\\\\     Against the grace and person of my master,\\\\     Stocking his messenger.\\\\  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,\\\\     There shall he sit till noon.\\\\  Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!\\\\  Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,\\\\     You should not use me so.\\\\  Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will.\\\\  Corn. This is a fellow of the selfsame colour\\\\     Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!\\\\                                             Stocks brought out.\\\\  Glou. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.\\\\     His fault is much, and the good King his master\\\\     Will check him for't. Your purpos'd low correction\\\\     Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches\\\\     For pilf'rings and most common trespasses\\\\     Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill\\\\     That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,\\\\     Should have him thus restrain'd.\\\\  Corn. I'll answer that.\\\\  Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,\\\\     To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,\\\\     For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-\\\\                                    [Kent is put in the stocks.]\\\\     Come, my good lord, away.\\\\                           Exeunt [all but Gloucester and Kent].\\\\  Glou. I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,\\\\     Whose disposition, all the world well knows,\\\\     Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee.\\\\  Kent. Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.\\\\     Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.\\\\     A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.\\\\     Give you good morrow!\\\\  Glou. The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.\\\\Exit.\\\\  Kent. Good King, that must approve the common saw,\\\\     Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st\\\\     To the warm sun!\\\\     Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,\\\\     That by thy comfortable beams I may\\\\     Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles\\\\     But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,\\\\     Who hath most fortunately been inform'd\\\\     Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time\\\\     From this enormous state, seeking to give\\\\     Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,\\\\     Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold\\\\     This shameful lodging.\\\\     Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.\\\\                                                         Sleeps.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene III.\\\\The open country.\\\\\\\\Enter Edgar.\\\\\\\\  Edg. I heard myself proclaim'd,\\\\     And by the happy hollow of a tree\\\\     Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place\\\\     That guard and most unusual vigilance\\\\     Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,\\\\     I will preserve myself; and am bethought\\\\     To take the basest and most poorest shape\\\\     That ever penury, in contempt of man,\\\\     Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,\\\\     Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,\\\\     And with presented nakedness outface\\\\     The winds and persecutions of the sky.\\\\     The country gives me proof and precedent\\\\     Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\\\\     Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms\\\\     Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\\\\     And with this horrible object, from low farms,\\\\     Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,\\\\     Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\\\\     Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'\\\\     That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.             Exit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene IV.\\\\Before Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks.\\\\\\\\Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.\\\\\\\\  Lear. 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,\\\\     And not send back my messenger.\\\\  Gent. As I learn'd,\\\\     The night before there was no purpose in them\\\\     Of this remove.\\\\  Kent. Hail to thee, noble master!\\\\  Lear. Ha!\\\\     Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?\\\\  Kent. No, my lord.\\\\  Fool. Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by\\\\the\\\\     head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and\\\\men\\\\     by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears\\\\     wooden nether-stocks.\\\\  Lear. What's he that hath so much thy place mistook\\\\     To set thee here?\\\\  Kent. It is both he and she-\\\\     Your son and daughter.\\\\  Lear. No.\\\\  Kent. Yes.\\\\  Lear. No, I say.\\\\  Kent. I say yea.\\\\  Lear. No, no, they would not!\\\\  Kent. Yes, they have.\\\\  Lear. By Jupiter, I swear no!\\\\  Kent. By Juno, I swear ay!\\\\  Lear. They durst not do't;\\\\     They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther\\\\     To do upon respect such violent outrage.\\\\     Resolve me with all modest haste which way\\\\     Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,\\\\     Coming from us.\\\\  Kent. My lord, when at their home\\\\     I did commend your Highness' letters to them,\\\\     Ere I was risen from the place that show'd\\\\     My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,\\\\     Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth\\\\     From Goneril his mistress salutations;\\\\     Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,\\\\     Which presently they read; on whose contents,\\\\     They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,\\\\     Commanded me to follow and attend\\\\     The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,\\\\     And meeting here the other messenger,\\\\     Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-\\\\     Being the very fellow which of late\\\\     Display'd so saucily against your Highness-\\\\     Having more man than wit about me, drew.\\\\     He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.\\\\     Your son and daughter found this trespass worth\\\\     The shame which here it suffers.\\\\  Fool. Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.\\\\\\\\          Fathers that wear rags\\\\            Do make their children blind;\\\\          But fathers that bear bags\\\\            Shall see their children kind.\\\\          Fortune, that arrant whore,\\\\          Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.\\\\\\\\     But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy\\\\     daughters as thou canst tell in a year.\\\\  Lear. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!\\\\     Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!\\\\     Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?\\\\  Kent. With the Earl, sir, here within.\\\\  Lear. Follow me not;\\\\     Stay here.                                            Exit.\\\\  Gent. Made you no more offence but what you speak of?\\\\  Kent. None.\\\\     How chance the King comes with so small a number?\\\\  Fool. An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,\\\\     thou'dst well deserv'd it.\\\\  Kent. Why, fool?\\\\  Fool. We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's\\\\no\\\\     labouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led\\\\by\\\\     their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among\\\\twenty\\\\     but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a\\\\great\\\\     wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with\\\\following\\\\     it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee\\\\after.\\\\     When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine\\\\again. I\\\\     would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.\\\\          That sir which serves and seeks for gain,\\\\            And follows but for form,\\\\          Will pack when it begins to rain\\\\            And leave thee in the storm.\\\\          But I will tarry; the fool will stay,\\\\            And let the wise man fly.\\\\          The knave turns fool that runs away;\\\\            The fool no knave, perdy.\\\\  Kent. Where learn'd you this, fool?\\\\  Fool. Not i' th' stocks, fool.\\\\\\\\                      Enter Lear and Gloucester\\\\\\\\  Lear. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?\\\\     They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-\\\\     The images of revolt and flying off!\\\\     Fetch me a better answer.\\\\  Glou. My dear lord,\\\\     You know the fiery quality of the Duke,\\\\     How unremovable and fix'd he is\\\\     In his own course.\\\\  Lear. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!\\\\     Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,\\\\     I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.\\\\  Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.\\\\  Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?\\\\  Glou. Ay, my good lord.\\\\  Lear. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father\\\\     Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.\\\\     Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!\\\\     Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-\\\\     No, but not yet! May be he is not well.\\\\     Infirmity doth still neglect all office\\\\     Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves\\\\     When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind\\\\     To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;\\\\     And am fallen out with my more headier will,\\\\     To take the indispos'd and sickly fit\\\\     For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore\\\\     Should be sit here? This act persuades me\\\\     That this remotion of the Duke and her\\\\     Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.\\\\     Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-\\\\     Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,\\\\     Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum\\\\     Till it cry sleep to death.\\\\  Glou. I would have all well betwixt you.                 Exit.\\\\  Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!\\\\  Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when\\\\she\\\\     put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs\\\\with\\\\     a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother\\\\that,\\\\     in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.\\\\\\\\             Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.\\\\\\\\  Lear. Good morrow to you both.\\\\  Corn. Hail to your Grace!\\\\                                       Kent here set at liberty.\\\\  Reg. I am glad to see your Highness.\\\\  Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason\\\\     I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,\\\\     I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,\\\\     Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?\\\\     Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,\\\\     Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied\\\\     Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!\\\\                                   [Lays his hand on his heart.]\\\\     I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe\\\\     With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!\\\\  Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope\\\\     You less know how to value her desert\\\\     Than she to scant her duty.\\\\  Lear. Say, how is that?\\\\  Reg. I cannot think my sister in the least\\\\     Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance\\\\     She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,\\\\     'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,\\\\     As clears her from all blame.\\\\  Lear. My curses on her!\\\\  Reg. O, sir, you are old!\\\\     Nature in you stands on the very verge\\\\     Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led\\\\     By some discretion that discerns your state\\\\     Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you\\\\     That to our sister you do make return;\\\\     Say you have wrong'd her, sir.\\\\  Lear. Ask her forgiveness?\\\\     Do you but mark how this becomes the house:\\\\     'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.          [Kneels.]\\\\     Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg\\\\     That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'\\\\  Reg. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.\\\\     Return you to my sister.\\\\  Lear. [rises] Never, Regan!\\\\     She hath abated me of half my train;\\\\     Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,\\\\     Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.\\\\     All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall\\\\     On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,\\\\     You taking airs, with lameness!\\\\  Corn. Fie, sir, fie!\\\\  Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames\\\\     Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,\\\\     You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,\\\\     To fall and blast her pride!\\\\  Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on me\\\\     When the rash mood is on.\\\\  Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.\\\\     Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give\\\\     Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine\\\\     Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee\\\\     To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,\\\\     To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,\\\\     And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt\\\\     Against my coming in. Thou better know'st\\\\     The offices of nature, bond of childhood,\\\\     Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.\\\\     Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,\\\\     Wherein I thee endow'd.\\\\  Reg. Good sir, to th' purpose.\\\\                                                  Tucket within.\\\\  Lear. Who put my man i' th' stocks?\\\\  Corn. What trumpet's that?\\\\  Reg. I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,\\\\     That she would soon be here.\\\\\\\\                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\\\\\\\\     Is your lady come?\\\\  Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride\\\\     Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.\\\\     Out, varlet, from my sight!\\\\  Corn. What means your Grace?\\\\\\\\                            Enter Goneril.\\\\\\\\  Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope\\\\     Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!\\\\     If you do love old men, if your sweet sway\\\\     Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,\\\\     Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!\\\\     [To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-\\\\     O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?\\\\  Gon. Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?\\\\     All's not offence that indiscretion finds\\\\     And dotage terms so.\\\\  Lear. O sides, you are too tough!\\\\     Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?\\\\  Corn. I set him there, sir; but his own disorders\\\\     Deserv'd much less advancement.\\\\  Lear. You? Did you?\\\\  Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\\\\     If, till the expiration of your month,\\\\     You will return and sojourn with my sister,\\\\     Dismissing half your train, come then to me.\\\\     I am now from home, and out of that provision\\\\     Which shall be needful for your entertainment.\\\\  Lear. Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?\\\\     No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose\\\\     To wage against the enmity o' th' air,\\\\     To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-\\\\     Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?\\\\     Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took\\\\     Our youngest born, I could as well be brought\\\\     To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg\\\\     To keep base life afoot. Return with her?\\\\     Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter\\\\     To this detested groom.                 [Points at Oswald.]\\\\  Gon. At your choice, sir.\\\\  Lear. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.\\\\     I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.\\\\     We'll no more meet, no more see one another.\\\\     But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;\\\\     Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,\\\\     Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,\\\\     A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle\\\\     In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.\\\\     Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.\\\\     I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot\\\\     Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.\\\\     Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;\\\\     I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,\\\\     I and my hundred knights.\\\\  Reg. Not altogether so.\\\\     I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided\\\\     For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;\\\\     For those that mingle reason with your passion\\\\     Must be content to think you old, and so-\\\\     But she knows what she does.\\\\  Lear. Is this well spoken?\\\\  Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?\\\\     Is it not well? What should you need of more?\\\\     Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\\\\     Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house\\\\     Should many people, under two commands,\\\\     Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.\\\\  Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance\\\\     From those that she calls servants, or from mine?\\\\  Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,\\\\     We could control them. If you will come to me\\\\     (For now I spy a danger), I entreat you\\\\     To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more\\\\     Will I give place or notice.\\\\  Lear. I gave you all-\\\\  Reg. And in good time you gave it!\\\\  Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries;\\\\     But kept a reservation to be followed\\\\     With such a number. What, must I come to you\\\\     With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?\\\\  Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me.\\\\  Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd\\\\     When others are more wicked; not being the worst\\\\     Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with\\\\thee.\\\\     Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,\\\\     And thou art twice her love.\\\\  Gon. Hear, me, my lord.\\\\     What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,\\\\     To follow in a house where twice so many\\\\     Have a command to tend you?\\\\  Reg. What need one?\\\\  Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars\\\\     Are in the poorest thing superfluous.\\\\     Allow not nature more than nature needs,\\\\     Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:\\\\     If only to go warm were gorgeous,\\\\     Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st\\\\     Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-\\\\     You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!\\\\     You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,\\\\     As full of grief as age; wretched in both.\\\\     If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts\\\\     Against their father, fool me not so much\\\\     To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,\\\\     And let not women's weapons, water drops,\\\\     Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!\\\\     I will have such revenges on you both\\\\     That all the world shall- I will do such things-\\\\     What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be\\\\     The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.\\\\     No, I'll not weep.\\\\     I have full cause of weeping, but this heart\\\\     Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws\\\\     Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!\\\\              Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and\\\\                                                        tempest.\\\\  Corn. Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.\\\\  Reg. This house is little; the old man and 's people\\\\     Cannot be well bestow'd.\\\\  Gon. 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest\\\\     And must needs taste his folly.\\\\  Reg. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,\\\\     But not one follower.\\\\  Gon. So am I purpos'd.\\\\     Where is my Lord of Gloucester?\\\\  Corn. Followed the old man forth.\\\\\\\\                          Enter Gloucester.\\\\\\\\     He is return'd.\\\\  Glou. The King is in high rage.\\\\  Corn. Whither is he going?\\\\  Glou. He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.\\\\  Corn. 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.\\\\  Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.\\\\  Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds\\\\     Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about\\\\     There's scarce a bush.\\\\  Reg. O, sir, to wilful men\\\\     The injuries that they themselves procure\\\\     Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.\\\\     He is attended with a desperate train,\\\\     And what they may incense him to, being apt\\\\     To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.\\\\  Corn. Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.\\\\     My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.\\\\[Exeunt.]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\\\\SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\\\\PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\\\\WITH PERMISSION.

One minded like the weather, most unquietly.\\\\  Kent. I know you. Where's the King?\\\\  Gent. Contending with the fretful elements;\\\\     Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,\\\\     Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,\\\\     That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,\\\\     Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,\\\\     Catch in their fury and make nothing of;\\\\     Strives in his little world of man to outscorn\\\\     The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.\\\\     This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,\\\\     The lion and the belly-pinched wolf\\\\     Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,\\\\     And bids what will take all.\\\\  Kent. But who is with him?\\\\  Gent. None but the fool, who labours to outjest\\\\     His heart-struck injuries.\\\\  Kent. Sir, I do know you,\\\\     And dare upon the warrant of my note\\\\     Commend a dear thing to you. There is division\\\\     (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd\\\\     With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;\\\\     Who have (as who have not, that their great stars\\\\     Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,\\\\     Which are to France the spies and speculations\\\\     Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,\\\\     Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,\\\\     Or the hard rein which both of them have borne\\\\     Against the old kind King, or something deeper,\\\\     Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-\\\\     But, true it is, from France there comes a power\\\\     Into this scattered kingdom, who already,\\\\     Wise in our negligence, have secret feet\\\\     In some of our best ports and are at point\\\\     To show their open banner. Now to you:\\\\     If on my credit you dare build so far\\\\     To make your speed to Dover, you shall find\\\\     Some that will thank you, making just report\\\\     Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow\\\\     The King hath cause to plain.\\\\     I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,\\\\     And from some knowledge and assurance offer\\\\     This office to you.\\\\  Gent. I will talk further with you.\\\\  Kent. No, do not.\\\\     For confirmation that I am much more\\\\     Than my out-wall, open this purse and take\\\\     What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia\\\\     (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,\\\\     And she will tell you who your fellow is\\\\     That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!\\\\     I will go seek the King.\\\\  Gent. Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?\\\\  Kent. Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:\\\\     That, when we have found the King (in which your pain\\\\     That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him\\\\     Holla the other.\\\\                                             Exeunt [severally].\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene II.\\\\Another part of the heath.\\\\\\\\Storm still. Enter Lear and Fool.\\\\\\\\  Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!\\\\     You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout\\\\     Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!\\\\     You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,\\\\     Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,\\\\     Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,\\\\     Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,\\\\     Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,\\\\     That makes ingrateful man!\\\\  Fool. O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than\\\\this\\\\     rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy\\\\daughters\\\\     blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.\\\\  Lear. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!\\\\     Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.\\\\     I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.\\\\     I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,\\\\     You owe me no subscription. Then let fall\\\\     Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,\\\\     A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.\\\\     But yet I call you servile ministers,\\\\     That will with two pernicious daughters join\\\\     Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head\\\\     So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!\\\\  Fool. He that has a house to put 's head in has a good\\\\head-piece.\\\\          The codpiece that will house\\\\            Before the head has any,\\\\          The head and he shall louse:\\\\            So beggars marry many.\\\\          The man that makes his toe\\\\            What he his heart should make\\\\          Shall of a corn cry woe,\\\\            And turn his sleep to wake.\\\\     For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a\\\\     glass.\\\\\\\\                             Enter Kent.\\\\\\\\  Lear. No, I will be the pattern of all patience;\\\\     I will say nothing.\\\\  Kent. Who's there?\\\\  Fool. Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and\\\\a\\\\     fool.\\\\  Kent. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night\\\\     Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies\\\\     Gallow the very wanderers of the dark\\\\     And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,\\\\     Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,\\\\     Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never\\\\     Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry\\\\     Th' affliction nor the fear.\\\\  Lear. Let the great gods,\\\\     That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,\\\\     Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,\\\\     That hast within thee undivulged crimes\\\\     Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;\\\\     Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue\\\\     That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake\\\\     That under covert and convenient seeming\\\\     Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,\\\\     Rive your concealing continents, and cry\\\\     These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man\\\\     More sinn'd against than sinning.\\\\  Kent. Alack, bareheaded?\\\\     Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;\\\\     Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.\\\\     Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house\\\\     (More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,\\\\     Which even but now, demanding after you,\\\\     Denied me to come in) return, and force\\\\     Their scanted courtesy.\\\\  Lear. My wits begin to turn.\\\\     Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?\\\\     I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?\\\\     The art of our necessities is strange,\\\\     That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.\\\\     Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart\\\\     That's sorry yet for thee.\\\\  Fool. [sings]\\\\\\\\          He that has and a little tiny wit-\\\\            With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-\\\\          Must make content with his fortunes fit,\\\\             For the rain it raineth every day.\\\\\\\\  Lear. True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.\\\\                                         Exeunt [Lear and Kent].\\\\  Fool. This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a\\\\     prophecy ere I go:\\\\          When priests are more in word than matter;\\\\          When brewers mar their malt with water;\\\\          When nobles are their tailors' tutors,\\\\          No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;\\\\          When every case in law is right,\\\\          No squire in debt nor no poor knight;\\\\          When slanders do not live in tongues,\\\\          Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;\\\\          When usurers tell their gold i' th' field,\\\\          And bawds and whores do churches build:\\\\          Then shall the realm of Albion\\\\          Come to great confusion.\\\\          Then comes the time, who lives to see't,\\\\          That going shall be us'd with feet.\\\\     This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.\\\\Exit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene III.\\\\Gloucester's Castle.\\\\\\\\Enter Gloucester and Edmund.\\\\\\\\  Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing!\\\\When\\\\     I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from\\\\me\\\\     the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual\\\\     displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor\\\\any\\\\     way sustain him.\\\\  Edm. Most savage and unnatural!\\\\  Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the\\\\Dukes,\\\\     and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this\\\\     night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter\\\\in\\\\     my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be\\\\revenged\\\\     home; there's part of a power already footed; we must\\\\incline to\\\\     the King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you\\\\and\\\\     maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him\\\\     perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.\\\\Though I\\\\     die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old\\\\master\\\\     must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward,\\\\Edmund.\\\\     Pray you be careful.                                  Exit.\\\\  Edm. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke\\\\     Instantly know, and of that letter too.\\\\     This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me\\\\     That which my father loses- no less than all.\\\\     The younger rises when the old doth fall.             Exit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene IV.\\\\The heath. Before a hovel.\\\\\\\\Storm still. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.\\\\\\\\  Kent. Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.\\\\     The tyranny of the open night 's too rough\\\\     For nature to endure.\\\\  Lear. Let me alone.\\\\  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.\\\\  Lear. Wilt break my heart?\\\\  Kent. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.\\\\  Lear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm\\\\     Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;\\\\     But where the greater malady is fix'd,\\\\     The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;\\\\     But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,\\\\     Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,\\\\     The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind\\\\     Doth from my senses take all feeling else\\\\     Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!\\\\     Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand\\\\     For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!\\\\     No, I will weep no more. In such a night\\\\     'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.\\\\     In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!\\\\     Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!\\\\     O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!\\\\     No more of that.\\\\  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.\\\\  Lear. Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.\\\\     This tempest will not give me leave to ponder\\\\     On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.\\\\     [To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-\\\\     Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.\\\\                                                    Exit [Fool].\\\\     Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,\\\\     That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,\\\\     How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,\\\\     Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you\\\\     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en\\\\     Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;\\\\     Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,\\\\     That thou mayst shake the superflux to them\\\\     And show the heavens more just.\\\\  Edg. [within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!\\\\\\\\                     Enter Fool [from the hovel].\\\\\\\\  Fool. Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help\\\\me!\\\\  Kent. Give me thy hand. Who's there?\\\\  Fool. A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom.\\\\  Kent. What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?\\\\     Come forth.\\\\\\\\                 Enter Edgar [disguised as a madman].\\\\\\\\  Edg. Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp\\\\hawthorn\\\\     blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm\\\\thee.\\\\  Lear. Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou\\\\come\\\\     to this?\\\\  Edg. Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath\\\\led\\\\     through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool,\\\\o'er\\\\     bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and\\\\     halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him\\\\proud\\\\     of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd\\\\     bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy\\\\five\\\\     wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from\\\\     whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some\\\\charity,\\\\     whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and\\\\there-\\\\     and there again- and there!\\\\                                                    Storm still.\\\\  Lear. What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?\\\\     Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?\\\\  Fool. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.\\\\  Lear. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air\\\\     Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!\\\\  Kent. He hath no daughters, sir.\\\\  Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature\\\\     To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.\\\\     Is it the fashion that discarded fathers\\\\     Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?\\\\     Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot\\\\     Those pelican daughters.\\\\  Edg. Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo,\\\\loo!\\\\  Fool. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.\\\\  Edg. Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy\\\\word\\\\     justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set\\\\not\\\\     thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.\\\\  Lear. What hast thou been?\\\\  Edg. A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my\\\\hair,\\\\     wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart\\\\and\\\\     did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I\\\\spake\\\\     words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that\\\\     slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine\\\\lov'd\\\\     I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.\\\\     False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth,\\\\fox\\\\     in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in\\\\prey.\\\\     Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks\\\\betray\\\\     thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy\\\\hand\\\\     out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the\\\\foul\\\\     fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says\\\\     suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa!\\\\let\\\\     him trot by.\\\\                                                    Storm still.\\\\  Lear. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with\\\\thy\\\\     uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more\\\\than\\\\     this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the\\\\beast\\\\     no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's\\\\three\\\\     on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;\\\\     unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked\\\\     animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton\\\\     here.\\\\                                         [Tears at his clothes.]\\\\  Fool. Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to\\\\swim\\\\     in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old\\\\lecher's\\\\     heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look,\\\\here\\\\     comes a walking fire.\\\\\\\\                    Enter Gloucester with a torch.\\\\\\\\  Edg. This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at\\\\curfew,\\\\     and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin,\\\\     squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white\\\\wheat,\\\\     and hurts the poor creature of earth.\\\\\\\\           Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old;\\\\           He met the nightmare, and her nine fold;\\\\              Bid her alight\\\\              And her troth plight,\\\\           And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!\\\\\\\\  Kent. How fares your Grace?\\\\  Lear. What's he?\\\\  Kent. Who's there? What is't you seek?\\\\  Glou. What are you there? Your names?\\\\  Edg. Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the\\\\todpole,\\\\     the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart,\\\\when\\\\     the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows\\\\the\\\\     old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the\\\\     standing pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, and\\\\     stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to\\\\his\\\\     back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to\\\\     wear;\\\\\\\\          But mice and rats, and such small deer,\\\\          Have been Tom's food for seven long year.\\\\\\\\     Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend!\\\\  Glou. What, hath your Grace no better company?\\\\  Edg. The prince of darkness is a gentleman!\\\\     Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.\\\\  Glou. Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,\\\\     That it doth hate what gets it.\\\\  Edg. Poor Tom 's acold.\\\\  Glou. Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer\\\\     T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.\\\\     Though their injunction be to bar my doors\\\\     And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,\\\\     Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out\\\\     And bring you where both fire and food is ready.\\\\  Lear. First let me talk with this philosopher.\\\\     What is the cause of thunder?\\\\  Kent. Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.\\\\  Lear. I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.\\\\     What is your study?\\\\  Edg. How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.\\\\  Lear. Let me ask you one word in private.\\\\  Kent. Importune him once more to go, my lord.\\\\     His wits begin t' unsettle.\\\\  Glou. Canst thou blame him?\\\\                                                    Storm still.\\\\     His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!\\\\     He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!\\\\     Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,\\\\     I am almost mad myself. I had a son,\\\\     Now outlaw'd from my blood. He sought my life\\\\     But lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend-\\\\     No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,\\\\     The grief hath craz'd my wits. What a night 's this!\\\\     I do beseech your Grace-\\\\  Lear. O, cry you mercy, sir.\\\\     Noble philosopher, your company.\\\\  Edg. Tom's acold.\\\\  Glou. In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm.\\\\  Lear. Come, let's in all.\\\\  Kent. This way, my lord.\\\\  Lear. With him!\\\\     I will keep still with my philosopher.\\\\  Kent. Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.\\\\  Glou. Take him you on.\\\\  Kent. Sirrah, come on; go along with us.\\\\  Lear. Come, good Athenian.\\\\  Glou. No words, no words! hush.\\\\  Edg. Child Rowland to the dark tower came;\\\\     His word was still\\\\\\\\          Fie, foh, and fum!\\\\          I smell the blood of a British man.\\\\                                                         Exeunt.\\\\\\\\Scene V.\\\\Gloucester's Castle.\\\\\\\\Enter Cornwall and Edmund.\\\\\\\\  Corn. I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.\\\\  Edm. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives\\\\way to\\\\     loyalty, something fears me to think of.\\\\  Corn. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil\\\\     disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit,\\\\set\\\\     awork by a reproveable badness in himself.\\\\  Edm. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!\\\\     This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an\\\\     intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens!\\\\that\\\\     this treason were not- or not I the detector!\\\\  Corn. Go with me to the Duchess.\\\\  Edm. If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty\\\\     business in hand.\\\\  Corn.

Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman\\\\or a\\\\     yeoman.\\\\  Lear. A king, a king!\\\\  Fool. No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for\\\\he's a\\\\     mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.\\\\  Lear. To have a thousand with red burning spits\\\\     Come hizzing in upon 'em-\\\\  Edg. The foul fiend bites my back.\\\\  Fool. He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's\\\\     health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.\\\\  Lear. It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.\\\\     [To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.\\\\     [To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you\\\\she-foxes!\\\\  Edg. Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at\\\\trial,\\\\     madam?\\\\\\\\             Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.\\\\\\\\  Fool.      Her boat hath a leak,\\\\             And she must not speak\\\\           Why she dares not come over to thee.\\\\\\\\  Edg. The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a\\\\nightingale.\\\\     Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring. Croak\\\\     not, black angel; I have no food for thee.\\\\  Kent. How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.\\\\     Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?\\\\  Lear. I'll see their trial first.

Is your name Goneril?\\\\  Lear. She cannot deny it.\\\\  Fool. Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.\\\\  Lear.

Corruption in the place!\\\\     False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?\\\\  Edg. Bless thy five wits!\\\\  Kent. O pity! Sir, where is the patience now\\\\     That you so oft have boasted to retain?\\\\  Edg. [aside] My tears begin to take his part so much\\\\     They'll mar my counterfeiting.\\\\  Lear. The little dogs and all,\\\\     Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.\\\\  Edg. Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!\\\\           Be thy mouth or black or white,\\\\           Tooth that poisons if it bite;\\\\           Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,\\\\           Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,\\\\           Bobtail tyke or trundle-tall-\\\\           Tom will make them weep and wail;\\\\           For, with throwing thus my head,\\\\           Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.\\\\     Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and\\\\market\\\\     towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.\\\\  Lear. Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her\\\\     heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard\\\\     hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my\\\\     hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments.\\\\You'll\\\\     say they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd.\\\\  Kent. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.\\\\  Lear. Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.\\\\     So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so.\\\\  Fool.

No more! The text is foolish.\\\\  Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;\\\\     Filths savour but themselves.

Another way\\\\     The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer.\\\\Exit.\\\\  Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?\\\\  Gent. Come with my lady hither.\\\\  Alb. He is not here.\\\\  Gent. No, my good lord; I met him back again.\\\\  Alb. Knows he the wickedness?\\\\  Gent. Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him,\\\\     And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment\\\\     Might have the freer course.\\\\  Alb. Gloucester, I live\\\\     To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King,\\\\     And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend.\\\\     Tell me what more thou know'st.\\\\                                                         Exeunt.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene III.\\\\The French camp near Dover.\\\\\\\\Enter Kent and a Gentleman.\\\\\\\\  Kent. Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you\\\\the\\\\     reason?\\\\  Gent. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his\\\\     coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so\\\\much\\\\     fear and danger that his personal return was most required\\\\and\\\\     necessary.\\\\  Kent. Who hath he left behind him general?\\\\  Gent. The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.\\\\  Kent. Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of\\\\     grief?\\\\  Gent. Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,\\\\     And now and then an ample tear trill'd down\\\\     Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen\\\\     Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,\\\\     Sought to be king o'er her.\\\\  Kent. O, then it mov'd her?\\\\  Gent. Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove\\\\     Who should express her goodliest. You have seen\\\\     Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears\\\\     Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets\\\\     That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know\\\\     What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence\\\\     As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,\\\\     Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,\\\\     If all could so become it.\\\\  Kent. Made she no verbal question?\\\\  Gent. Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father\\\\     Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;\\\\     Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!\\\\     Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night?\\\\     Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook\\\\     The holy water from her heavenly eyes,\\\\     And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started\\\\     To deal with grief alone.\\\\  Kent. It is the stars,\\\\     The stars above us, govern our conditions;\\\\     Else one self mate and mate could not beget\\\\     Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?\\\\  Gent. No.\\\\  Kent. Was this before the King return'd?\\\\  Gent. No, since.\\\\  Kent. Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;\\\\     Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers\\\\     What we are come about, and by no means\\\\     Will yield to see his daughter.\\\\  Gent. Why, good sir?\\\\  Kent. A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,\\\\     That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her\\\\     To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\\\\     To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting\\\\     His mind so venomously that burning shame\\\\     Detains him from Cordelia.\\\\  Gent. Alack, poor gentleman!\\\\  Kent. Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?\\\\  Gent. 'Tis so; they are afoot.\\\\  Kent. Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear\\\\     And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause\\\\     Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.\\\\     When I am known aright, you shall not grieve\\\\     Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go\\\\     Along with me.                                      Exeunt.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene IV.\\\\The French camp.\\\\\\\\Enter, with Drum and Colours, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers.\\\\\\\\  Cor. Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now\\\\     As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,\\\\     Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,\\\\     With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs,\\\\     Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\\\\     In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.\\\\     Search every acre in the high-grown field\\\\     And bring him to our eye.

But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?\\\\  Osw. Ay, madam.\\\\  Reg. Himself in person there?\\\\  Osw. Madam, with much ado.\\\\     Your sister is the better soldier.\\\\  Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?\\\\  Osw. No, madam.\\\\  Reg. What might import my sister's letter to him?\\\\  Osw. I know not, lady.\\\\  Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.\\\\     It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,\\\\     To let him live. Where he arrives he moves\\\\     All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,\\\\     In pity of his misery, to dispatch\\\\     His nighted life; moreover, to descry\\\\     The strength o' th' enemy.\\\\  Osw. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.\\\\  Reg. Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.\\\\     The ways are dangerous.\\\\  Osw. I may not, madam.\\\\     My lady charg'd my duty in this business.\\\\  Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you\\\\     Transport her purposes by word? Belike,\\\\     Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-\\\\     Let me unseal the letter.\\\\  Osw. Madam, I had rather-\\\\  Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband;\\\\     I am sure of that; and at her late being here\\\\     She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks\\\\     To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\\\\  Osw. I, madam?\\\\  Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.\\\\     Therefore I do advise you take this note.\\\\     My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,\\\\     And more convenient is he for my hand\\\\     Than for your lady's. You may gather more.\\\\     If you do find him, pray you give him this;\\\\     And when your mistress hears thus much from you,\\\\     I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.\\\\     So farewell.\\\\     If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\\\\     Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.\\\\  Osw. Would I could meet him, madam! I should show\\\\     What party I do follow.\\\\  Reg. Fare thee well.                                   Exeunt.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Scene VI.\\\\The country near Dover.\\\\\\\\Enter Gloucester, and Edgar [like a Peasant].\\\\\\\\  Glou. When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?\\\\  Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.\\\\  Glou. Methinks the ground is even.\\\\  Edg. Horrible steep.\\\\     Hark, do you hear the sea?\\\\  Glou. No, truly.\\\\  Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect\\\\     By your eyes' anguish.\\\\  Glou. So may it be indeed.\\\\     Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st\\\\     In better phrase and matter than thou didst.\\\\  Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd\\\\     But in my garments.\\\\  Glou. Methinks y'are better spoken.\\\\  Edg. Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful\\\\     And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!\\\\     The crows and choughs that wing the midway air\\\\     Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down\\\\     Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!\\\\     Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.\\\\     The fishermen that walk upon the beach\\\\     Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\\\\     Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy\\\\     Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge\\\\     That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes\\\\     Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,\\\\     Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\\\\     Topple down headlong.\\\\  Glou. Set me where you stand.\\\\  Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot\\\\     Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon\\\\     Would I not leap upright.\\\\  Glou. Let go my hand.\\\\     Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel\\\\     Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods\\\\     Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;\\\\     Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.\\\\  Edg. Now fare ye well, good sir.\\\\  Glou. With all my heart.\\\\  Edg. [aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair\\\\     Is done to cure it.\\\\  Glou. O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.\\\\     This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,\\\\     Shake patiently my great affliction off.\\\\     If I could bear it longer and not fall\\\\     To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,\\\\     My snuff and loathed part of nature should\\\\     Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!\\\\     Now, fellow, fare thee well.\\\\                                  He falls [forward and swoons].\\\\  Edg. Gone, sir, farewell.-\\\\     And yet I know not how conceit may rob\\\\     The treasury of life when life itself\\\\     Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,\\\\     By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?\\\\     Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-\\\\     Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.\\\\     What are you, sir?\\\\  Glou. Away, and let me die.\\\\  Edg. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\\\\     So many fadom down precipitating,\\\\     Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;\\\\     Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.\\\\     Ten masts at each make not the altitude\\\\     Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.\\\\     Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.\\\\  Glou. But have I fall'n, or no?\\\\  Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\\\\     Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far\\\\     Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.\\\\  Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!\\\\     Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit\\\\     To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort\\\\     When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage\\\\     And frustrate his proud will.\\\\  Edg. Give me your arm.\\\\     Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.\\\\  Glou. Too well, too well.\\\\  Edg. This is above all strangeness.\\\\     Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that\\\\     Which parted from you?\\\\  Glou. A poor unfortunate beggar.\\\\  Edg. As I stood here below, methought his eyes\\\\     Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\\\\     Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.\\\\     It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,\\\\     Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours\\\\     Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.\\\\  Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear\\\\     Affliction till it do cry out itself\\\\     'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,\\\\     I took it for a man. Often 'twould say\\\\     'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.\\\\  Edg. Bear free and patient thoughts.\\\\\\\\         Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].\\\\\\\\     But who comes here?\\\\     The safer sense will ne'er accommodate\\\\     His master thus.\\\\  Lear. No, they cannot touch me for coming;\\\\     I am the King himself.\\\\  Edg. O thou side-piercing sight!\\\\  Lear. Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press\\\\     money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw\\\\me\\\\     a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this\\\\piece\\\\     of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove\\\\it\\\\     on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!\\\\i'\\\\     th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.\\\\  Edg. Sweet marjoram.\\\\  Lear. Pass.\\\\  Glou. I know that voice.\\\\  Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a\\\\dog,\\\\     and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones\\\\     were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay'\\\\and\\\\     'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me\\\\     once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder\\\\would\\\\     not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt\\\\'em\\\\     out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I\\\\was\\\\     everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.\\\\  Glou. The trick of that voice I do well remember.\\\\     Is't not the King?\\\\  Lear. Ay, every inch a king!\\\\     When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\\\\     I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?\\\\     Adultery?\\\\     Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.\\\\     The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly\\\\     Does lecher in my sight.\\\\     Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son\\\\     Was kinder to his father than my daughters\\\\     Got 'tween the lawful sheets.\\\\     To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.\\\\     Behold yond simp'ring dame,\\\\     Whose face between her forks presageth snow,\\\\     That minces virtue, and does shake the head\\\\     To hear of pleasure's name.\\\\     The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't\\\\     With a more riotous appetite.\\\\     Down from the waist they are Centaurs,\\\\     Though women all above.\\\\     But to the girdle do the gods inherit,\\\\     Beneath is all the fiend's.\\\\     There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;\\\\     burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,\\\\pah!\\\\     Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my\\\\     imagination. There's money for thee.\\\\  Glou. O, let me kiss that hand!\\\\  Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\\\\  Glou. O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world\\\\     Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?\\\\  Lear. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at\\\\me?\\\\     No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this\\\\     challenge; mark but the penning of it.\\\\  Glou. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.\\\\  Edg. [aside] I would not take this from report. It is,\\\\     And my heart breaks at it.\\\\  Lear. Read.\\\\  Glou. What, with the case of eyes?\\\\  Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor\\\\no\\\\     money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your\\\\purse\\\\     in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.\\\\  Glou. I see it feelingly.\\\\  Lear. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no\\\\eyes.\\\\     Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond\\\\     simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and,\\\\handy-dandy,\\\\     which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a\\\\     farmer's dog bark at a beggar?\\\\  Glou. Ay, sir.\\\\  Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst\\\\behold\\\\     the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.\\\\     Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\\\\     Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.\\\\     Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\\\\     For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.\\\\     Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;\\\\     Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\\\\     And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;\\\\     Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.\\\\     None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.\\\\     Take that of me, my friend, who have the power\\\\     To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes\\\\     And, like a scurvy politician, seem\\\\     To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!\\\\     Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.\\\\  Edg. O, matter and impertinency mix'd!\\\\     Reason, in madness!\\\\  Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\\\\     I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.\\\\     Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;\\\\     Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air\\\\     We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.\\\\  Glou. Alack, alack the day!\\\\  Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come\\\\     To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.\\\\     It were a delicate stratagem to shoe\\\\     A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,\\\\     And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,\\\\     Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\\\\\\\\                 Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants].\\\\\\\\  Gent. O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,\\\\     Your most dear daughter-\\\\  Lear. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even\\\\     The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;\\\\     You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;\\\\     I am cut to th' brains.\\\\  Gent. You shall have anything.\\\\  Lear. No seconds? All myself?\\\\     Why, this would make a man a man of salt,\\\\     To use his eyes for garden waterpots,\\\\     Ay, and laying autumn's dust.\\\\  Gent. Good sir-\\\\  Lear. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!\\\\     I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;\\\\     My masters, know you that?\\\\  Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you.\\\\  Lear. Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get\\\\it\\\\     by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!\\\\                              Exit running. [Attendants follow.]\\\\  Gent. A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\\\\     Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter\\\\     Who redeems nature from the general curse\\\\     Which twain have brought her to.\\\\  Edg. Hail, gentle sir.\\\\  Gent. Sir, speed you. What's your will?\\\\  Edg. Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\\\\  Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that\\\\     Which can distinguish sound.\\\\  Edg. But, by your favour,\\\\     How near's the other army?\\\\  Gent. Near and on speedy foot. The main descry\\\\     Stands on the hourly thought.\\\\  Edg. I thank you sir. That's all.\\\\  Gent. Though that the Queen on special cause is here,\\\\     Her army is mov'd on.\\\\  Edg. I thank you, sir\\\\                                               Exit [Gentleman].\\\\  Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;\\\\     Let not my worser spirit tempt me again\\\\     To die before you please!\\\\  Edg. Well pray you, father.\\\\  Glou. Now, good sir, what are you?\\\\  Edg. A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,\\\\     Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\\\\     Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;\\\\     I'll lead you to some biding.\\\\  Glou.

So please your Majesty\\\\     That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.\\\\  Cor. Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed\\\\     I' th' sway of your own will. Is he array'd?\\\\\\\\              Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants.\\\\\\\\  Gent. Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep\\\\     We put fresh garments on him.\\\\  Doct. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.\\\\     I doubt not of his temperance.\\\\  Cor. Very well.\\\\                                                          Music.\\\\  Doct. Please you draw near. Louder the music there!\\\\  Cor. O my dear father, restoration hang\\\\     Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss\\\\     Repair those violent harms that my two sisters\\\\     Have in thy reverence made!\\\\  Kent. Kind and dear princess!\\\\  Cor. Had you not been their father, these white flakes\\\\     Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face\\\\     To be oppos'd against the warring winds?\\\\     To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?\\\\     In the most terrible and nimble stroke\\\\     Of quick cross lightning? to watch- poor perdu!-\\\\     With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,\\\\     Though he had bit me, should have stood that night\\\\     Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,\\\\     To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,\\\\     In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!\\\\     'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once\\\\     Had not concluded all.- He wakes. Speak to him.\\\\  Doct. Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.\\\\  Cor. How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?\\\\  Lear. You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.\\\\     Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound\\\\     Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears\\\\     Do scald like molten lead.\\\\  Cor. Sir, do you know me?\\\\  Lear. You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?\\\\  Cor. Still, still, far wide!\\\\  Doct. He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.\\\\  Lear. Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,\\\\     I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,\\\\     To see another thus. I know not what to say.\\\\     I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.\\\\     I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd\\\\     Of my condition!\\\\  Cor. O, look upon me, sir,\\\\     And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.\\\\     No, sir, you must not kneel.\\\\  Lear. Pray, do not mock me.\\\\     I am a very foolish fond old man,\\\\     Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;\\\\     And, to deal plainly,\\\\     I fear I am not in my perfect mind.\\\\     Methinks I should know you, and know this man;\\\\     Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant\\\\     What place this is; and all the skill I have\\\\     Remembers not these garments; nor I know not\\\\     Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;\\\\     For (as I am a man) I think this lady\\\\     To be my child Cordelia.\\\\  Cor. And so I am! I am!\\\\  Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.\\\\     If you have poison for me, I will drink it.\\\\     I know you do not love me; for your sisters\\\\     Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.\\\\     You have some cause, they have not.\\\\  Cor. No cause, no cause.\\\\  Lear. Am I in France?\\\\  Kent. In your own kingdom, sir.\\\\  Lear. Do not abuse me.\\\\  Doct. Be comforted, good madam. The great rage\\\\     You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger\\\\     To make him even o'er the time he has lost.\\\\     Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more\\\\     Till further settling.\\\\  Cor. Will't please your Highness walk?\\\\  Lear. You must bear with me.\\\\     Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.\\\\                              Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman.\\\\  Gent. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so\\\\slain?\\\\  Kent. Most certain, sir.\\\\  Gent. Who is conductor of his people?\\\\  Kent. As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.\\\\  Gent. They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of\\\\Kent\\\\     in Germany.\\\\  Kent. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers\\\\of\\\\     the kingdom approach apace.\\\\  Gent. The arbitrement is like to be bloody.\\\\     Fare you well, sir.

If thou dost\\\\     As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way\\\\     To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men\\\\     Are as the time is.

I'll do't, my lord.\\\\  Edm. About it! and write happy when th' hast done.\\\\     Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it so\\\\     As I have set it down.\\\\  Capt. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;\\\\     If it be man's work, I'll do't.                       Exit.\\\\\\\\          Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers.\\\\\\\\  Alb. Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,\\\\     And fortune led you well. You have the captives\\\\     Who were the opposites of this day's strife.\\\\     We do require them of you, so to use them\\\\     As we shall find their merits and our safety\\\\     May equally determine.\\\\  Edm. Sir, I thought it fit\\\\     To send the old and miserable King\\\\     To some retention and appointed guard;\\\\     Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,\\\\     To pluck the common bosom on his side\\\\     And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes\\\\     Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,\\\\     My reason all the same; and they are ready\\\\     To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear\\\\     Where you shall hold your session. At this time\\\\     We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;\\\\     And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd\\\\     By those that feel their sharpness.\\\\     The question of Cordelia and her father\\\\     Requires a fitter place.\\\\  Alb. Sir, by your patience,\\\\     I hold you but a subject of this war,\\\\     Not as a brother.\\\\  Reg. That's as we list to grace him.\\\\     Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded\\\\     Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,\\\\     Bore the commission of my place and person,\\\\     The which immediacy may well stand up\\\\     And call itself your brother.\\\\  Gon. Not so hot!\\\\     In his own grace he doth exalt himself\\\\     More than in your addition.\\\\  Reg. In my rights\\\\     By me invested, he compeers the best.\\\\  Gon. That were the most if he should husband you.\\\\  Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets.\\\\  Gon. Holla, holla!\\\\     That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.\\\\  Reg. Lady, I am not well; else I should answer\\\\     From a full-flowing stomach. General,\\\\     Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;\\\\     Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.\\\\     Witness the world that I create thee here\\\\     My lord and master.\\\\  Gon. Mean you to enjoy him?\\\\  Alb. The let-alone lies not in your good will.\\\\  Edm. Nor in thine, lord.\\\\  Alb. Half-blooded fellow, yes.\\\\  Reg. [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.\\\\\\\\  Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee\\\\     On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,\\\\     This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim,\\\\fair\\\\        sister,\\\\     I bar it in the interest of my wife.\\\\     'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,\\\\     And I, her husband, contradict your banes.\\\\     If you will marry, make your loves to me;\\\\     My lady is bespoke.\\\\  Gon. An interlude!\\\\  Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.\\\\     If none appear to prove upon thy person\\\\     Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,\\\\     There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'll prove it on\\\\thy\\\\        heart,\\\\     Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less\\\\     Than I have here proclaim'd thee.\\\\  Reg. Sick, O, sick!\\\\  Gon. [aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.\\\\  Edm. There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the\\\\world\\\\        he is\\\\     That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.\\\\     Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,\\\\     On him, on you, who not? I will maintain\\\\     My truth and honour firmly.\\\\  Alb. A herald, ho!\\\\  Edm. A herald, ho, a herald!\\\\  Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,\\\\     All levied in my name, have in my name\\\\     Took their discharge.\\\\  Reg. My sickness grows upon me.\\\\  Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.\\\\                                              [Exit Regan, led.]\\\\\\\\                           Enter a Herald.\\\\\\\\     Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,\\\\     And read out this.\\\\  Capt. Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.\\\\\\\\  Her. (reads) 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists\\\\of\\\\     the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of\\\\Gloucester,\\\\     that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third\\\\sound\\\\     of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'\\\\\\\\  Edm. Sound!                                     First trumpet.\\\\  Her. Again!                                    Second trumpet.\\\\  Her. Again!                                     Third trumpet.\\\\                                         Trumpet answers within.\\\\\\\\    Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him.\\\\\\\\  Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears\\\\     Upon this call o' th' trumpet.\\\\  Her. What are you?\\\\     Your name, your quality? and why you answer\\\\     This present summons?\\\\  Edg. Know my name is lost;\\\\     By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.\\\\     Yet am I noble as the adversary\\\\     I come to cope.\\\\  Alb. Which is that adversary?\\\\  Edg. What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?\\\\  Edm. Himself. What say'st thou to him?\\\\  Edg. Draw thy sword,\\\\     That, if my speech offend a noble heart,\\\\     Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.\\\\     Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,\\\\     My oath, and my profession. I protest-\\\\     Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,\\\\     Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,\\\\     Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;\\\\     False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;\\\\     Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;\\\\     And from th' extremest upward of thy head\\\\     To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,\\\\     A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'\\\\     This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent\\\\     To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,\\\\     Thou liest.\\\\  Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name;\\\\     But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,\\\\     And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,\\\\     What safe and nicely I might well delay\\\\     By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.\\\\     Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;\\\\     With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;\\\\     Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-\\\\     This sword of mine shall give them instant way\\\\     Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!\\\\                                 Alarums. Fight. [Edmund falls.]\\\\  Alb. Save him, save him!\\\\  Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester.\\\\     By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer\\\\     An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,\\\\     But cozen'd and beguil'd.\\\\  Alb. Shut your mouth, dame,\\\\     Or with this paper shall I stop it. [Shows her her letter to\\\\     Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir.\\\\     [To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.\\\\     No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.\\\\  Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.\\\\     Who can arraign me for't?\\\\  Alb. Most monstrous!\\\\     Know'st thou this paper?\\\\  Gon. Ask me not what I know.                             Exit.\\\\  Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.\\\\                                              [Exit an Officer.]\\\\  Edm. What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,\\\\     And more, much more. The time will bring it out.\\\\     'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou\\\\     That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,\\\\     I do forgive thee.\\\\  Edg. Let's exchange charity.\\\\     I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;\\\\     If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.\\\\     My name is Edgar and thy father's son.\\\\     The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\\\\     Make instruments to scourge us.\\\\     The dark and vicious place where thee he got\\\\     Cost him his eyes.\\\\  Edm. Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.\\\\     The wheel is come full circle; I am here.\\\\  Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy\\\\     A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.\\\\     Let sorrow split my heart if ever I\\\\     Did hate thee, or thy father!\\\\  Edg. Worthy prince, I know't.\\\\  Alb. Where have you hid yourself?\\\\     How have you known the miseries of your father?\\\\  Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;\\\\     And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!\\\\     The bloody proclamation to escape\\\\     That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!\\\\     That with the pain of death would hourly die\\\\     Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift\\\\     Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance\\\\     That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit\\\\     Met I my father with his bleeding rings,\\\\     Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,\\\\     Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;\\\\     Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him\\\\     Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,\\\\     Not sure, though hoping of this good success,\\\\     I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last\\\\     Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart\\\\     (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)\\\\     'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\\\\     Burst smilingly.\\\\  Edm. This speech of yours hath mov'd me,\\\\     And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;\\\\     You look as you had something more to say.\\\\  Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;\\\\     For I am almost ready to dissolve,\\\\     Hearing of this.\\\\  Edg. This would have seem'd a period\\\\     To such as love not sorrow; but another,\\\\     To amplify too much, would make much more,\\\\     And top extremity.\\\\     Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man,\\\\     Who, having seen me in my worst estate,\\\\     Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding\\\\     Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms\\\\     He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out\\\\     As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;\\\\     Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him\\\\     That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting\\\\     His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life\\\\     Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,\\\\     And there I left him tranc'd.\\\\  Alb. But who was this?\\\\  Edg. Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise\\\\     Followed his enemy king and did him service\\\\     Improper for a slave.\\\\\\\\                Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.\\\\\\\\  Gent. Help, help! O, help!\\\\  Edg. What kind of help?\\\\  Alb. Speak, man.\\\\  Edg. What means that bloody knife?\\\\  Gent.

First there is the Neopolitane Prince\\\\\\\\   Por.

Than is there the Countie Palentine\\\\\\\\   Por. He doth nothing but frowne (as who should\\\\say, and you will not haue me, choose: he heares merrie\\\\tales and smiles not, I feare hee will proue the weeping\\\\Phylosopher when he growes old, being so full of vnmannerly\\\\sadnesse in his youth.) I had rather to be married\\\\to a deaths head with a bone in his mouth, then to either\\\\of these: God defend me from these two\\\\\\\\   Ner. How say you by the French Lord, Mounsier\\\\Le Boune?\\\\  Por. God made him, and therefore let him passe for a\\\\man, in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,\\\\why he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans, a better\\\\bad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine, he\\\\is euery man in no man, if a Trassell sing, he fals straight\\\\a capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. If I should\\\\marry him, I should marry twentie husbands: if hee\\\\would despise me, I would forgiue him, for if he loue me\\\\to madnesse, I should neuer requite him\\\\\\\\   Ner. What say you then to Fauconbridge, the yong\\\\Baron of England?\\\\  Por. You know I say nothing to him, for hee vnderstands\\\\not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latine, French,\\\\nor Italian, and you will come into the Court & sweare\\\\that I haue a poore pennie-worth in the English: hee is a\\\\proper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with a\\\\dumbe show? how odly he is suited, I thinke he bought\\\\his doublet in Italie, his round hose in France, his bonnet\\\\in Germanie, and his behauiour euery where\\\\\\\\   Ner. What thinke you of the other Lord his neighbour?\\\\  Por. That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, for\\\\he borrowed a boxe of the eare of the Englishman, and\\\\swore he would pay him againe when hee was able: I\\\\thinke the Frenchman became his suretie, and seald vnder\\\\for another\\\\\\\\   Ner. How like you the yong Germaine, the Duke of\\\\Saxonies Nephew?\\\\  Por. Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,\\\\and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:\\\\when he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and when\\\\he is worst, he is little better then a beast: and the worst\\\\fall that euer fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without\\\\him\\\\\\\\   Ner. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right\\\\Casket, you should refuse to performe your Fathers will,\\\\if you should refuse to accept him\\\\\\\\   Por. Therefore for feare of the worst, I pray thee set\\\\a deepe glasse of Reinish-wine on the contrary Casket,\\\\for if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,\\\\I know he will choose it. I will doe any thing Nerrissa\\\\ere I will be married to a spunge\\\\\\\\   Ner. You neede not feare Lady the hauing any of\\\\these Lords, they haue acquainted me with their determinations,\\\\which is indeede to returne to their home,\\\\and to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you may\\\\be won by some other sort then your Fathers imposition,\\\\depending on the Caskets\\\\\\\\   Por. If I liue to be as olde as Sibilla, I will dye as\\\\chaste as Diana: vnlesse I be obtained by the manner\\\\of my Fathers will: I am glad this parcell of wooers\\\\are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but\\\\I doate on his verie absence: and I wish them a faire departure\\\\\\\\   Ner. Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fathers\\\\time, a Venecian, a Scholler and a Souldior that\\\\came hither in companie of the Marquesse of Mountferrat?\\\\  Por. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I thinke, so was hee\\\\call'd\\\\\\\\   Ner. True Madam, hee of all the men that euer my\\\\foolish eyes look'd vpon, was the best deseruing a faire\\\\Lady\\\\\\\\   Por. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy\\\\of thy praise.\\\\Enter a Seruingman.\\\\\\\\  Ser. The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take\\\\their leaue: and there is a fore-runner come from a fift,\\\\the Prince of Moroco, who brings word the Prince his\\\\Maister will be here to night\\\\\\\\   Por. If I could bid the fift welcome with so good\\\\heart as I can bid the other foure farewell, I should be\\\\glad of his approach: if he haue the condition of a Saint,\\\\and the complexion of a diuell, I had rather hee should\\\\shriue me then wiue me. Come Nerrissa, sirra go before;\\\\whiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer, another\\\\knocks at the doore.\\\\\\\\Exeunt.\\\\\\\\Enter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew.\\\\\\\\  Shy. Three thousand ducates, well\\\\\\\\   Bass. I sir, for three months\\\\\\\\   Shy. For three months, well\\\\\\\\   Bass. For the which, as I told you,\\\\Anthonio shall be bound\\\\\\\\   Shy. Anthonio shall become bound, well\\\\\\\\   Bass. May you sted me? Will you pleasure me?\\\\Shall I know your answere\\\\\\\\   Shy.

Haue you heard any imputation to the contrary\\\\\\\\   Shy. Ho no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a\\\\good man, is to haue you vnderstand me that he is sufficient,\\\\yet his meanes are in supposition: he hath an Argosie\\\\bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies, I vnderstand\\\\moreouer vpon the Ryalta, he hath a third at Mexico,\\\\a fourth for England, and other ventures hee hath\\\\squandred abroad, but ships are but boords, Saylers but\\\\men, there be land rats, and water rats, water theeues,\\\\and land theeues, I meane Pyrats, and then there is the\\\\perrill of waters, windes, and rocks: the man is not withstanding\\\\sufficient, three thousand ducats, I thinke I may\\\\take his bond\\\\\\\\   Bas. Be assured you may\\\\\\\\   Iew. I will be assured I may: and that I may be assured,\\\\I will bethinke mee, may I speake with Anthonio?\\\\  Bass. If it please you to dine with vs\\\\\\\\   Iew. Yes, to smell porke, to eate of the habitation\\\\which your Prophet the Nazarite coniured the diuell\\\\into: I will buy with you, sell with you, talke with\\\\you, walke with you, and so following: but I will\\\\not eate with you, drinke with you, nor pray with you.\\\\What newes on the Ryalta, who is he comes here?\\\\Enter Anthonio.\\\\\\\\  Bass. This is signior Anthonio\\\\\\\\   Iew. How like a fawning publican he lookes.\\\\I hate him for he is a Christian:\\\\But more, for that in low simplicitie\\\\He lends out money gratis, and brings downe\\\\The rate of vsance here with vs in Venice.\\\\If I can catch him once vpon the hip,\\\\I will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him.\\\\He hates our sacred Nation, and he railes\\\\Euen there where Merchants most doe congregate\\\\On me, my bargaines, and my well-worne thrift,\\\\Which he cals interrest: Cursed by my Trybe\\\\If I forgiue him\\\\\\\\   Bass. Shylock, doe you heare\\\\\\\\   Shy. I am debating of my present store,\\\\And by the neere gesse of my memorie\\\\I cannot instantly raise vp the grosse\\\\Of full three thousand ducats: what of that?\\\\Tuball a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe\\\\Will furnish me: but soft, how many months\\\\Doe you desire? Rest you faire good signior,\\\\Your worship was the last man in our mouthes\\\\\\\\   Ant. Shylocke, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\\\\By taking, nor by giuing of excesse,\\\\Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\\\\Ile breake a custome: is he yet possest\\\\How much he would?\\\\  Shy. I, I, three thousand ducats\\\\\\\\   Ant. And for three months\\\\\\\\   Shy. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.\\\\Well then, your bond: and let me see, but heare you,\\\\Me thoughts you said, you neither lend nor borrow\\\\Vpon aduantage\\\\\\\\   Ant.

No, not take interest, not as you would say\\\\Directly interest, marke what Iacob did,\\\\When Laban and himselfe were compremyz'd\\\\That all the eanelings which were streakt and pied\\\\Should fall as Iacobs hier, the Ewes being rancke,\\\\In end of Autumne turned to the Rammes,\\\\And when the worke of generation was\\\\Betweene these woolly breeders in the act,\\\\The skilfull shepheard pil'd me certaine wands,\\\\And in the dooing of the deede of kinde,\\\\He stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes,\\\\Who then conceauing, did in eaning time\\\\Fall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Iacobs.\\\\This was a way to thriue, and he was blest:\\\\And thrift is blessing if men steale it not\\\\\\\\   Ant. This was a venture sir that Iacob seru'd for,\\\\A thing not in his power to bring to passe,\\\\But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heauen.\\\\Was this inserted to make interrest good?\\\\Or is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams?\\\\  Shy. I cannot tell, I make it breede as fast,\\\\But note me signior\\\\\\\\   Ant. Marke you this Bassanio,\\\\The diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose,\\\\An euill soule producing holy witnesse,\\\\Is like a villaine with a smiling cheeke,\\\\A goodly apple rotten at the heart.\\\\O what a goodly outside falsehood hath\\\\\\\\   Shy. Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.\\\\Three months from twelue, then let me see the rate\\\\\\\\   Ant. Well Shylocke, shall we be beholding to you?\\\\  Shy.

Yes truly; for looke you, the sinnes of the Father\\\\are to be laid vpon the children, therefore I promise\\\\you, I feare you, I was alwaies plaine with you, and so\\\\now I speake my agitation of the matter: therfore be of\\\\good cheere, for truly I thinke you are damn'd, there is\\\\but one hope in it that can doe you anie good, and that is\\\\but a kinde of bastard hope neither\\\\\\\\   Iessica. And what hope is that I pray thee?\\\\  Clow. Marrie you may partlie hope that your father\\\\got you not, that you are not the Iewes daughter\\\\\\\\   Ies. That were a kinde of bastard hope indeed, so the\\\\sins of my mother should be visited vpon me\\\\\\\\   Clow. Truly then I feare you are damned both by father\\\\and mother: thus when I shun Scilla your father, I\\\\fall into Charibdis your mother; well, you are gone both\\\\waies\\\\\\\\   Ies. I shall be sau'd by my husband, he hath made me\\\\a Christian\\\\\\\\   Clow. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians\\\\enow before, e'ne as many as could wel liue one by another:\\\\this making of Christians will raise the price of\\\\Hogs, if wee grow all to be porke-eaters, wee shall not\\\\shortlie haue a rasher on the coales for money.\\\\Enter Lorenzo.\\\\\\\\  Ies. Ile tell my husband Lancelet what you say, heere\\\\he comes\\\\\\\\   Loren. I shall grow iealous of you shortly Lancelet,\\\\if you thus get my wife into corners?\\\\  Ies. Nay, you need not feare vs Lorenzo, Launcelet\\\\and I are out, he tells me flatly there is no mercy for mee\\\\in heauen, because I am a Iewes daughter: and hee saies\\\\you are no good member of the common wealth, for\\\\in conuerting Iewes to Christians, you raise the price\\\\of Porke\\\\\\\\   Loren. I shall answere that better to the Commonwealth,\\\\than you can the getting vp of the Negroes bellie:\\\\the Moore is with childe by you Launcelet?\\\\  Clow. It is much that the Moore should be more then\\\\reason: but if she be lesse then an honest woman, shee is\\\\indeed more then I tooke her for\\\\\\\\   Loren. How euerie foole can play vpon the word, I\\\\thinke the best grace of witte will shortly turne into silence,\\\\and discourse grow commendable in none onely\\\\but Parrats: goe in sirra, bid them prepare for dinner?\\\\  Clow. That is done sir, they haue all stomacks?\\\\  Loren. Goodly Lord, what a witte-snapper are you,\\\\then bid them prepare dinner\\\\\\\\   Clow. That is done to sir, onely couer is the word\\\\\\\\   Loren. Will you couer than sir?\\\\  Clow. Not so sir neither, I know my dutie\\\\\\\\   Loren. Yet more quarreling with occasion, wilt thou\\\\shew the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant; I pray\\\\thee vnderstand a plaine man in his plaine meaning: goe\\\\to thy fellowes, bid them couer the table, serue in the\\\\meat, and we will come in to dinner\\\\\\\\   Clow. For the table sir, it shall be seru'd in, for the\\\\meat sir, it shall bee couered, for your comming in to\\\\dinner sir, why let it be as humors and conceits shall gouerne.\\\\\\\\Exit Clowne.\\\\\\\\  Lor. O deare discretion, how his words are suted,\\\\The foole hath planted in his memory\\\\An Armie of good words, and I doe know\\\\A many fooles that stand in better place,\\\\Garnisht like him, that for a tricksie word\\\\Defie the matter: how cheer'st thou Iessica,\\\\And now good sweet say thy opinion,\\\\How dost thou like the Lord Bassiano's wife?\\\\  Iessi. Past all expressing, it is very meete\\\\The Lord Bassanio liue an vpright life\\\\For hauing such a blessing in his Lady,\\\\He findes the ioyes of heauen heere on earth,\\\\And if on earth he doe not meane it, it\\\\Is reason he should neuer come to heauen?\\\\Why, if two gods should play some heauenly match,\\\\And on the wager lay two earthly women,\\\\And Portia one: there must be something else\\\\Paund with the other, for the poore rude world\\\\Hath not her fellow\\\\\\\\   Loren. Euen such a husband\\\\Hast thou of me, as she is for a wife\\\\\\\\   Ies. Nay, but aske my opinion to of that?\\\\  Lor. I will anone, first let vs goe to dinner?\\\\  Ies.

I, so he sayes\\\\\\\\   Por. Do you confesse the bond?\\\\  Ant. I do\\\\\\\\   Por. Then must the Iew be mercifull\\\\\\\\   Iew. On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that\\\\\\\\   Por. The quality of mercy is not strain'd,\\\\It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen\\\\Vpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\\\\It blesseth him that giues, and him that takes,\\\\'Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes\\\\The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.\\\\His Scepter shewes the force of temporall power,\\\\The attribute to awe and Maiestie,\\\\Wherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings:\\\\But mercy is aboue this sceptred sway,\\\\It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,\\\\It is an attribute to God himselfe;\\\\And earthly power doth then shew likest Gods\\\\When mercie seasons Iustice. Therefore Iew,\\\\Though Iustice be thy plea, consider this,\\\\That in the course of Iustice, none of vs\\\\Should see saluation: we do pray for mercie,\\\\And that same prayer, doth teach vs all to render\\\\The deeds of mercie. I haue spoke thus much\\\\To mittigate the iustice of thy plea:\\\\Which if thou follow, this strict course of Venice\\\\Must needes giue sentence 'gainst the Merchant there\\\\\\\\   Shy. My deeds vpon my head, I craue the Law,\\\\The penaltie and forfeite of my bond\\\\\\\\   Por. Is he not able to discharge the money?\\\\  Bas. Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,\\\\Yea, twice the summe, if that will not suffice,\\\\I will be bound to pay it ten times ore,\\\\On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:\\\\If this will not suffice, it must appeare\\\\That malice beares downe truth. And I beseech you\\\\Wrest once the Law to your authority.\\\\To do a great right, do a little wrong,\\\\And curbe this cruell diuell of his will\\\\\\\\   Por. It must not be, there is no power in Venice\\\\Can alter a decree established:\\\\'Twill be recorded for a President,\\\\And many an error by the same example,\\\\Will rush into the state: It cannot be\\\\\\\\   Iew. A Daniel come to iudgement, yea a Daniel.\\\\O wise young Iudge, how do I honour thee\\\\\\\\   Por. I pray you let me looke vpon the bond\\\\\\\\   Iew. Heere 'tis most reuerend Doctor, heere it is\\\\\\\\   Por. Shylocke, there's thrice thy monie offered thee\\\\\\\\   Shy. An oath, an oath, I haue an oath in heauen:\\\\Shall I lay periurie vpon my soule?\\\\No not for Venice\\\\\\\\   Por. Why this bond is forfeit,\\\\And lawfully by this the Iew may claime\\\\A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\\\\Neerest the Merchants heart; be mercifull,\\\\Take thrice thy money, bid me teare the bond\\\\\\\\   Iew. When it is paid according to the tenure.\\\\It doth appeare you are a worthy Iudge:\\\\You know the Law, your exposition\\\\Hath beene most sound. I charge you by the Law,\\\\Whereof you are a well-deseruing pillar,\\\\Proceede to iudgement: By my soule I sweare,\\\\There is no power in the tongue of man\\\\To alter me: I stay heere on my bond\\\\\\\\   An. Most heartily I do beseech the Court\\\\To giue the iudgement\\\\\\\\   Por. Why then thus it is:\\\\You must prepare your bosome for his knife\\\\\\\\   Iew. O noble Iudge, O excellent yong man\\\\\\\\   Por. For the intent and purpose of the Law\\\\Hath full relation to the penaltie,\\\\Which heere appeareth due vpon the bond\\\\\\\\   Iew. 'Tis verie true: O wise and vpright Iudge,\\\\How much more elder art thou then thy lookes?\\\\  Por. Therefore lay bare your bosome\\\\\\\\   Iew. I, his brest,\\\\So sayes the bond, doth it not noble Iudge?\\\\Neerest his heart, those are the very words\\\\\\\\   Por. It is so: Are there ballance heere to weigh the\\\\flesh?\\\\  Iew. I haue them ready\\\\\\\\   Por. Haue by some Surgeon Shylock on your charge\\\\To stop his wounds, least he should bleede to death\\\\\\\\   Iew. It is not nominated in the bond?\\\\  Por. It is not so exprest: but what of that?\\\\'Twere good you do so much for charitie\\\\\\\\   Iew. I cannot finde it, 'tis not in the bond\\\\\\\\   Por. Come Merchant, haue you any thing to say?\\\\  Ant. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.\\\\Giue me your hand Bassanio, fare you well.\\\\Greeue not that I am falne to this for you:\\\\For heerein fortune shewes her selfe more kinde\\\\Then is her custome. It is still her vse\\\\To let the wretched man out-liue his wealth,\\\\To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow\\\\An age of pouerty. From which lingring penance\\\\Of such miserie, doth she cut me off:\\\\Commend me to your honourable Wife,\\\\Tell her the processe of Anthonio's end:\\\\Say how I lou'd you; speake me faire in death:\\\\And when the tale is told, bid her be iudge,\\\\Whether Bassanio had not once a Loue:\\\\Repent not you that you shall loose your friend,\\\\And he repents not that he payes your debt.\\\\For if the Iew do cut but deepe enough,\\\\Ile pay it instantly, with all my heart\\\\\\\\   Bas. Anthonio, I am married to a wife,\\\\Which is as deere to me as life it selfe,\\\\But life it selfe, my wife, and all the world,\\\\Are not with me esteem'd aboue thy life.\\\\I would loose all, I sacrifice them all\\\\Heere to this deuill, to deliuer you\\\\\\\\   Por. Your wife would giue you little thanks for that\\\\If she were by to heare you make the offer\\\\\\\\   Gra. I haue a wife whom I protest I loue,\\\\I would she were in heauen, so she could\\\\Intreat some power to change this currish Iew\\\\\\\\   Ner. 'Tis well you offer it behinde her backe,\\\\The wish would make else an vnquiet house\\\\\\\\   Iew. These be the Christian husbands: I haue a daughter\\\\Would any of the stocke of Barrabas\\\\Had beene her husband, rather then a Christian.\\\\We trifle time, I pray thee pursue sentence\\\\\\\\   Por. A pound of that same marchants flesh is thine,\\\\The Court awards it, and the law doth giue it\\\\\\\\   Iew. Most rightfull Iudge\\\\\\\\   Por. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast,\\\\The Law allowes it, and the Court awards it\\\\\\\\   Iew. Most learned Iudge, a sentence, come prepare\\\\\\\\   Por. Tarry a little, there is something else,\\\\This bond doth giue thee heere no iot of bloud,\\\\The words expresly are a pound of flesh:\\\\Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,\\\\But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\\\\One drop of Christian bloud, thy lands and goods\\\\Are by the Lawes of Venice confiscate\\\\Vnto the state of Venice\\\\\\\\   Gra. O vpright Iudge,\\\\Marke Iew, o learned Iudge\\\\\\\\   Shy. Is that the law?\\\\  Por. Thy selfe shalt see the Act:\\\\For as thou vrgest iustice, be assur'd\\\\Thou shalt haue iustice more then thou desirest\\\\\\\\   Gra. O learned Iudge, mark Iew, a learned Iudge\\\\\\\\   Iew. I take this offer then, pay the bond thrice,\\\\And let the Christian goe\\\\\\\\   Bass. Heere is the money\\\\\\\\   Por. Soft, the Iew shall haue all iustice, soft, no haste,\\\\He shall haue nothing but the penalty\\\\\\\\   Gra. O Iew, an vpright Iudge, a learned Iudge\\\\\\\\   Por. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh,\\\\Shed thou no bloud, nor cut thou lesse nor more\\\\But iust a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more\\\\Or lesse then a iust pound, be it so much\\\\As makes it light or heauy in the substance,\\\\Or the deuision of the twentieth part\\\\Of one poore scruple, nay if the scale doe turne\\\\But in the estimation of a hayre,\\\\Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate\\\\\\\\   Gra. A second Daniel, a Daniel Iew,\\\\Now infidell I haue thee on the hip\\\\\\\\   Por. Why doth the Iew pause, take thy forfeiture\\\\\\\\   Shy. Giue me my principall, and let me goe\\\\\\\\   Bass. I haue it ready for thee, heere it is\\\\\\\\   Por. He hath refus'd it in the open Court,\\\\He shall haue meerly iustice and his bond\\\\\\\\   Gra.

For ought that euer I could reade,\\\\Could euer heare by tale or historie,\\\\The course of true loue neuer did run smooth,\\\\But either it was different in blood\\\\\\\\   Her. O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue\\\\\\\\   Lys. Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares\\\\\\\\   Her. O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong\\\\\\\\   Lys. Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit\\\\\\\\   Her. O hell! to choose loue by anothers eie\\\\\\\\   Lys. Or if there were a simpathie in choise,\\\\Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it;\\\\Making it momentarie, as a sound:\\\\Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame,\\\\Briefe as the lightning in the collied night,\\\\That (in a spleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth;\\\\And ere a man hath power to say, behold,\\\\The iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp:\\\\So quicke bright things come to confusion\\\\\\\\   Her. If then true Louers haue beene euer crost,\\\\It stands as an edict in destinie:\\\\Then let vs teach our triall patience,\\\\Because it is a customarie crosse,\\\\As due to loue, as thoughts, and dreames, and sighes,\\\\Wishes and teares; poore Fancies followers\\\\\\\\   Lys. A good perswasion; therefore heare me Hermia,\\\\I haue a Widdow Aunt, a dowager,\\\\Of great reuennew, and she hath no childe,\\\\From Athens is her house remou'd seuen leagues,\\\\And she respects me, as her onely sonne:\\\\There gentle Hermia, may I marrie thee,\\\\And to that place, the sharpe Athenian Law\\\\Cannot pursue vs. If thou lou'st me, then\\\\Steale forth thy Fathers house to morrow night:\\\\And in the wood, a league without the towne,\\\\(Where I did meete thee once with Helena.\\\\To do obseruance for a morne of May)\\\\There will I stay for thee\\\\\\\\   Her. My good Lysander,\\\\I sweare to thee, by Cupids strongest bow,\\\\By his best arrow with the golden head,\\\\By the simplicitie of Venus Doues,\\\\By that which knitteth soules, and prospers loue,\\\\And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queene,\\\\When the false Troyan vnder saile was seene,\\\\By all the vowes that euer men haue broke,\\\\(In number more then euer women spoke)\\\\In that same place thou hast appointed me,\\\\To morrow truly will I meete with thee\\\\\\\\   Lys. Keepe promise loue: looke here comes Helena.\\\\Enter Helena.\\\\\\\\  Her. God speede faire Helena, whither away?\\\\  Hel. Cal you me faire? that faire againe vnsay,\\\\Demetrius loues you faire: O happie faire!\\\\Your eyes are loadstarres, and your tongues sweete ayre\\\\More tuneable then Larke to shepheards eare,\\\\When wheate is greene, when hauthorne buds appeare,\\\\Sicknesse is catching: O were fauor so,\\\\Your words I catch, faire Hermia ere I go,\\\\My eare should catch your voice, my eye, your eye,\\\\My tongue should catch your tongues sweete melodie,\\\\Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\\\\The rest Ile giue to be to you translated.\\\\O teach me how you looke, and with what art\\\\You sway the motion of Demetrius hart\\\\\\\\   Her. I frowne vpon him, yet he loues me still\\\\\\\\   Hel. O that your frownes would teach my smiles\\\\such skil\\\\\\\\   Her. I giue him curses, yet he giues me loue\\\\\\\\   Hel. O that my prayers could such affection mooue\\\\\\\\   Her. The more I hate, the more he followes me\\\\\\\\   Hel. The more I loue, the more he hateth me\\\\\\\\   Her. His folly Helena is none of mine\\\\\\\\   Hel. None but your beauty, wold that fault wer mine\\\\  Her. Take comfort: he no more shall see my face,\\\\Lysander and my selfe will flie this place.\\\\Before the time I did Lysander see,\\\\Seem'd Athens like a Paradise to mee.\\\\O then, what graces in my Loue do dwell,\\\\That he hath turn'd a heauen into hell\\\\\\\\   Lys. Helen, to you our mindes we will vnfold,\\\\To morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\\\\Her siluer visage, in the watry glasse,\\\\Decking with liquid pearle, the bladed grasse\\\\(A time that Louers flights doth still conceale)\\\\Through Athens gates, haue we deuis'd to steale\\\\\\\\   Her. And in the wood, where often you and I,\\\\Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye,\\\\Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell sweld:\\\\There my Lysander, and my selfe shall meete,\\\\And thence from Athens turne away our eyes\\\\To seeke new friends and strange companions,\\\\Farwell sweet play-fellow, pray thou for vs,\\\\And good lucke grant thee thy Demetrius.\\\\Keepe word Lysander we must starue our sight,\\\\From louers foode, till morrow deepe midnight.\\\\\\\\Exit Hermia.\\\\\\\\  Lys. I will my Hermia. Helena adieu,\\\\As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you.\\\\\\\\Exit Lysander.\\\\\\\\  Hele. How happy some, ore othersome can be?\\\\Through Athens I am thought as faire as she.\\\\But what of that? Demetrius thinkes not so:\\\\He will not know, what all, but he doth know,\\\\And as hee erres, doting on Hermias eyes;\\\\So I, admiring of his qualities:\\\\Things base and vilde, holding no quantity,\\\\Loue can transpose to forme and dignity,\\\\Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde,\\\\And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blinde.\\\\Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste:\\\\Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste.\\\\And therefore is Loue said to be a childe,\\\\Because in choise he is often beguil'd,\\\\As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare;\\\\So the boy Loue is periur'd euery where.\\\\For ere Demetrius lookt on Hermias eyne,\\\\He hail'd downe oathes that he was onely mine.\\\\And when this Haile some heat from Hermia felt,\\\\So he dissolu'd, and showres of oathes did melt,\\\\I will goe tell him of faire Hermias flight:\\\\Then to the wood will he, to morrow night\\\\Pursue her; and for his intelligence,\\\\If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence:\\\\But heerein meane I to enrich my paine,\\\\To haue his sight thither, and backe againe.\\\\Enter.\\\\\\\\Enter Quince the Carpenter, Snug the Ioyner, Bottome the Weauer,\\\\Flute\\\\the bellowes-mender, Snout the Tinker, and Starueling the Taylor.\\\\\\\\  Quin. Is all our company heere?\\\\  Bot. You were best to call them generally, man by\\\\man according to the scrip\\\\\\\\   Qui. Here is the scrowle of euery mans name, which\\\\is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enterlude\\\\before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding\\\\day at night\\\\\\\\   Bot. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats\\\\on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on\\\\to a point\\\\\\\\   Quin. Marry our play is the most lamentable comedy,\\\\and most cruell death of Pyramus and Thisbie\\\\\\\\   Bot. A very good peece of worke I assure you, and a\\\\merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors\\\\by the scrowle. Masters spread your selues\\\\\\\\   Quince. Answere as I call you. Nick Bottome the\\\\Weauer\\\\\\\\   Bottome. Ready; name what part I am for, and\\\\proceed\\\\\\\\   Quince. You Nicke Bottome are set downe for Pyramus\\\\\\\\   Bot. What is Pyramus, a louer, or a tyrant?\\\\  Quin. A Louer that kills himselfe most gallantly for\\\\loue\\\\\\\\   Bot. That will aske some teares in the true performing\\\\of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies:\\\\I will mooue stormes; I will condole in some measure.\\\\To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could\\\\play Ercles rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all\\\\split the raging Rocks; and shiuering shocks shall break\\\\the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus carre shall shine\\\\from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This\\\\was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This\\\\is Ercles vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condoling\\\\\\\\   Quin. Francis Flute the Bellowes-mender\\\\\\\\   Flu. Heere Peter Quince\\\\\\\\   Quin. You must take Thisbie on you\\\\\\\\   Flut. What is Thisbie, a wandring Knight?\\\\  Quin. It is the Lady that Pyramus must loue\\\\\\\\   Flut. Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a\\\\beard comming\\\\\\\\   Qui. That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and\\\\you may speake as small as you will\\\\\\\\   Bot. And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbie too:\\\\Ile speake in a monstrous little voyce; Thisne, Thisne, ah\\\\Pyramus my louer deare, thy Thisbie deare, and Lady\\\\deare\\\\\\\\   Quin. No no, you must play Pyramus, and Flute, you\\\\Thisby\\\\\\\\   Bot. Well, proceed\\\\\\\\   Qu. Robin Starueling the Taylor\\\\\\\\   Star. Heere Peter Quince\\\\\\\\   Quince. Robin Starueling, you must play Thisbies\\\\mother?\\\\Tom Snowt, the Tinker\\\\\\\\   Snowt. Heere Peter Quince\\\\\\\\   Quin. you, Pyramus father; my self, Thisbies father;\\\\Snugge the Ioyner, you the Lyons part: and I hope there\\\\is a play fitted\\\\\\\\   Snug. Haue you the Lions part written? pray you if\\\\be, giue it me, for I am slow of studie\\\\\\\\   Quin. You may doe it extemporie, for it is nothing\\\\but roaring\\\\\\\\   Bot. Let mee play the Lyon too, I will roare that I\\\\will doe any mans heart good to heare me. I will roare,\\\\that I will make the Duke say, Let him roare againe, let\\\\him roare againe\\\\\\\\   Quin. If you should do it too terribly, you would\\\\fright the Dutchesse and the Ladies, that they would\\\\shrike, and that were enough to hang us all\\\\\\\\   All. That would hang vs euery mothers sonne\\\\\\\\   Bottome. I graunt you friends, if that you should\\\\fright the Ladies out of their Wittes, they would\\\\haue no more discretion but to hang vs: but I will aggrauate\\\\my voyce so, that I will roare you as gently as\\\\any sucking Doue; I will roare and 'twere any Nightingale\\\\\\\\   Quin. You can play no part but Piramus, for Piramus\\\\is a sweet-fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in\\\\a summers day; a most louely Gentleman-like man, therfore\\\\you must needs play Piramus\\\\\\\\   Bot. Well, I will vndertake it. What beard were I\\\\best to play it in?\\\\  Quin. Why, what you will\\\\\\\\   Bot. I will discharge it, in either your straw-colour\\\\beard, your orange tawnie beard, your purple in graine\\\\beard, or your French-crowne colour'd beard, your perfect\\\\yellow\\\\\\\\   Quin. Some of your French Crownes haue no haire\\\\at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But masters here\\\\are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and\\\\desire you, to con them by too morrow night: and meet\\\\me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by\\\\Moone-light, there we will rehearse: for if we meete in\\\\the Citie, we shalbe dog'd with company, and our deuises\\\\knowne. In the meane time, I wil draw a bil of properties,\\\\such as our play wants. I pray you faile me not\\\\\\\\   Bottom. We will meete, and there we may rehearse\\\\more obscenely and couragiously. Take paines, be perfect,\\\\adieu\\\\\\\\   Quin. At the Dukes oake we meete\\\\\\\\   Bot. Enough, hold or cut bow-strings.\\\\\\\\Exeunt.\\\\\\\\\"},\n",

Lysander on the ground;\\\\Deade or asleepe? I see no bloud, no wound,\\\\Lysander, if you liue, good sir awake\\\\\\\\   Lys. And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.\\\\Transparent Helena, nature her shewes art,\\\\That through thy bosome makes me see thy heart.\\\\Where is Demetrius? oh how fit a word\\\\Is that vile name, to perish on my sword!\\\\  Hel. Do not say so Lysander, say not so:\\\\What though he loue your Hermia? Lord, what though?\\\\Yet Hermia still loues you; then be content\\\\\\\\   Lys. Content with Hermia? no, I do repent\\\\The tedious minutes I with her haue spent.\\\\Not Hermia, but Helena now I loue;\\\\Who will not change a Rauen for a Doue?\\\\The will of man is by his reason sway'd:\\\\And reason saies you are the worthier Maide.\\\\Things growing are not ripe vntill their season;\\\\So I being yong, till now ripe not to reason,\\\\And touching now the point of humane skill,\\\\Reason becomes the Marshall to my will.\\\\And leades me to your eyes, where I orelooke\\\\Loues stories, written in Loues richest booke\\\\\\\\   Hel.

This greene plot shall be our\\\\stage, this hauthorne brake our tyring house, and we will\\\\do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke\\\\\\\\   Bot. Peter Quince?\\\\  Peter. What saist thou, bully Bottome?\\\\  Bot. There are things in this Comedy of Piramus and\\\\Thisby, that will neuer please. First, Piramus must draw a\\\\sword to kill himselfe; which the Ladies cannot abide.\\\\How answere you that?\\\\  Snout. Berlaken, a parlous feare\\\\\\\\   Star. I beleeue we must leaue the killing out, when\\\\all is done\\\\\\\\   Bot. Not a whit, I haue a deuice to make all well.\\\\Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seeme to say,\\\\we will do no harme with our swords, and that Pyramus\\\\is not kill'd indeede: and for the more better assurance,\\\\tell them, that I Piramus am not Piramus, but Bottome the\\\\Weauer; this will put them out of feare\\\\\\\\   Quin. Well, we will haue such a Prologue, and it shall\\\\be written in eight and sixe\\\\\\\\   Bot. No, make it two more, let it be written in eight\\\\and eight\\\\\\\\   Snout. Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lyon?\\\\  Star. I feare it, I promise you\\\\\\\\   Bot. Masters, you ought to consider with your selues, to\\\\bring in (God shield vs) a Lyon among Ladies, is a most\\\\dreadfull thing. For there is not a more fearefull wilde\\\\foule then your Lyon liuing: and wee ought to looke\\\\to it\\\\\\\\   Snout. Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not\\\\a Lyon\\\\\\\\   Bot. Nay, you must name his name, and halfe his face\\\\must be seene through the Lyons necke, and he himselfe\\\\must speake through, saying thus, or to the same defect;\\\\Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would\\\\request you, or I would entreat you, not to feare, not to\\\\tremble: my life for yours. If you thinke I come hither\\\\as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no such\\\\thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let\\\\him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is Snug the\\\\ioyner\\\\\\\\   Quin. Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard\\\\things, that is, to bring the Moone-light into a chamber:\\\\for you know Piramus and Thisby meete by Moonelight\\\\\\\\   Sn. Doth the Moone shine that night wee play our\\\\play?\\\\  Bot. A Calender, a Calender, looke in the Almanack,\\\\finde out Moone-shine, finde out Moone-shine.\\\\Enter Pucke.\\\\\\\\  Quin. Yes, it doth shine that night\\\\\\\\   Bot. Why then may you leaue a casement of the great\\\\chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moone\\\\may shine in at the casement\\\\\\\\   Quin. I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns\\\\and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present\\\\the person of Moone-shine. Then there is another\\\\thing, we must haue a wall in the great Chamber; for Piramus\\\\and Thisby (saies the story) did talke through the\\\\chinke of a wall\\\\\\\\   Sn. You can neuer bring in a wall. What say you\\\\Bottome?\\\\  Bot. Some man or other must present wall, and let\\\\him haue some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough\\\\cast about him, to signifie wall; or let him hold his fingers\\\\thus; and through that cranny shall Piramus and\\\\Thisby whisper\\\\\\\\   Quin. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit\\\\downe euery mothers sonne, and rehearse your parts.\\\\Piramus, you begin; when you haue spoken your speech,\\\\enter into that Brake, and so euery one according to his\\\\cue.\\\\Enter Robin.\\\\\\\\  Rob. What hempen home-spuns haue we swaggering\\\\here,\\\\So neere the Cradle of the Faierie Queene?\\\\What, a Play toward? Ile be an auditor,\\\\An Actor too perhaps, if I see cause\\\\\\\\   Quin.

Most radiant Piramus, most Lilly white of hue,\\\\Of colour like the red rose on triumphant bryer,\\\\Most brisky Iuuenall, and eke most louely Iew,\\\\As true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre,\\\\Ile meete thee Piramus, at Ninnies toombe\\\\\\\\   Pet.

It is not so\\\\\\\\   De. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,\\\\Lest to thy perill thou abide it deare.\\\\Looke where thy Loue comes, yonder is thy deare.\\\\Enter Hermia.\\\\\\\\  Her. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,\\\\The eare more quicke of apprehension makes,\\\\Wherein it doth impaire the seeing sense,\\\\It paies the hearing double recompence.\\\\Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander found,\\\\Mine eare (I thanke it) brought me to that sound.\\\\But why vnkindly didst thou leaue me so?\\\\  Lysan. Why should hee stay whom Loue doth presse to go?\\\\  Her. What loue could presse Lysander from my side?\\\\  Lys. Lysanders loue (that would not let him bide)\\\\Faire Helena; who more engilds the night,\\\\Then all yon fierie oes, and eies of light.\\\\Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know,\\\\The hate I bare thee, made me leaue thee so?\\\\  Her. You speake not as you thinke; it cannot be\\\\\\\\   Hel. Loe, she is one of this confederacy,\\\\Now I perceiue they haue conioyn'd all three,\\\\To fashion this false sport in spight of me.\\\\Iniurous Hermia, most vngratefull maid,\\\\Haue you conspir'd, haue you with these contriu'd\\\\To baite me, with this foule derision?\\\\Is all the counsell that we two haue shar'd,\\\\The sisters vowes, the houres that we haue spent,\\\\When wee haue chid the hasty footed time,\\\\For parting vs; O, is all forgot?\\\\All schooledaies friendship, child-hood innocence?\\\\We Hermia, like two Artificiall gods,\\\\Haue with our needles, created both one flower,\\\\Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,\\\\Both warbling of one song, both in one key:\\\\As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindes\\\\Had beene incorporate. So we grew together,\\\\Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,\\\\But yet a vnion in partition,\\\\Two louely berries molded on one stem,\\\\So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,\\\\Two of the first life coats in Heraldry,\\\\Due but to one and crowned with one crest.\\\\And will you rent our ancient loue asunder,\\\\To ioyne with men in scorning your poore friend?\\\\It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly.\\\\Our sexe as well as I, may chide you for it,\\\\Though I alone doe feele the iniurie\\\\\\\\   Her.

Haue you not set Lysander, as in scorne\\\\To follow me, and praise my eies and face?\\\\And made your other loue, Demetrius\\\\(Who euen but now did spurne me with his foote)\\\\To call me goddesse, nimph, diuine, and rare,\\\\Precious, celestiall? Wherefore speakes he this\\\\To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander\\\\Denie your loue (so rich within his soule)\\\\And tender me (forsooth) affection,\\\\But by your setting on, by your consent?\\\\What though I be not so in grace as you,\\\\So hung vpon with loue, so fortunate?\\\\(But miserable most, to loue vnlou'd)\\\\This you should pittie, rather then despise\\\\\\\\   Her. I vnderstand not what you meane by this\\\\\\\\   Hel.

Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I\\\\haue had a most rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit\\\\of man, to say, what dreame it was. Man is but an Asse,\\\\if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me-thought I\\\\was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was,\\\\and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch'd foole,\\\\if he will offer to say, what me-thought I had. The eye of\\\\man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not seen, mans\\\\hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his\\\\heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get Peter\\\\Quince to write a ballet of this dreame, it shall be called\\\\Bottomes Dreame, because it hath no bottome; and I will\\\\sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peraduenture,\\\\to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it\\\\at her death.\\\\Enter.\\\\\\\\Enter Quince, Flute, Thisbie, Snout, and Starueling.\\\\\\\\  Quin. Haue you sent to Bottomes house? Is he come\\\\home yet?\\\\  Staru. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt hee is\\\\transported\\\\\\\\   This. If he come not, then the play is mar'd. It goes\\\\not forward, doth it?\\\\  Quin. It is not possible: you haue not a man in all\\\\Athens, able to discharge Piramus but he\\\\\\\\   This. No, hee hath simply the best wit of any handycraft\\\\man in Athens\\\\\\\\   Quin. Yea, and the best person too, and hee is a very\\\\Paramour, for a sweet voyce\\\\\\\\   This. You must say, Paragon. A Paramour is (God\\\\blesse vs) a thing of nought.\\\\Enter Snug the Ioyner.\\\\\\\\  Snug. Masters, the Duke is comming from the Temple,\\\\and there is two or three Lords & Ladies more married.\\\\If our sport had gone forward, we had all bin made\\\\men\\\\\\\\   This. O sweet bully Bottome: thus hath he lost sixepence\\\\a day, during his life; he could not haue scaped sixpence\\\\a day. And the Duke had not giuen him sixpence\\\\a day for playing Piramus, Ile be hang'd. He would haue\\\\deserued it. Sixpence a day in Piramus, or nothing.\\\\Enter Bottome.\\\\\\\\  Bot. Where are these Lads? Where are these hearts?\\\\  Quin. Bottome, o most couragious day! O most happie\\\\houre!\\\\  Bot. Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me\\\\not what. For if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I\\\\will tell you euery thing as it fell out\\\\\\\\   Qu. Let vs heare, sweet Bottome\\\\\\\\   Bot. Not a word of me: all that I will tell you, is, that\\\\the Duke hath dined. Get your apparell together, good\\\\strings to your beards, new ribbands to your pumps,\\\\meete presently at the Palace, euery man looke ore his\\\\part: for the short and the long is, our play is preferred:\\\\In any case let Thisby haue cleane linnen: and let not him\\\\that playes the Lion, paire his nailes, for they shall hang\\\\out for the Lions clawes. And most deare Actors, eate\\\\no Onions, nor Garlicke; for wee are to vtter sweete\\\\breath, and I doe not doubt but to heare them say, it is a\\\\sweet Comedy.

For if you will know,\\\\By moone-shine did these Louers thinke no scorne\\\\To meet at Ninus toombe, there, there to wooe:\\\\This grizly beast (which Lyon hight by name)\\\\The trusty Thisby, comming first by night,\\\\Did scarre away, or rather did affright:\\\\And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;\\\\Which Lyon vile with bloody mouth did staine.\\\\Anon comes Piramus, sweet youth and tall,\\\\And findes his Thisbies Mantle slaine;\\\\Whereat, with blade, with bloody blamefull blade,\\\\He brauely broacht his boiling bloudy breast,\\\\And Thisby, tarrying in Mulberry shade,\\\\His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,\\\\Let Lyon, Moone-shine, Wall, and Louers twaine,\\\\At large discourse, while here they doe remaine.\\\\\\\\Exit all but Wall.\\\\\\\\  Thes. I wonder if the Lion be to speake\\\\\\\\   Deme. No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when\\\\many Asses doe.\\\\\\\\Exit Lyon, Thisbie, and Mooneshine.\\\\\\\\  Wall. In this same Interlude, it doth befall,\\\\That I, one Snowt (by name) present a wall:\\\\And such a wall, as I would haue you thinke,\\\\That had in it a crannied hole or chinke:\\\\Through which the Louers, Piramus and Thisbie\\\\Did whisper often, very secretly.\\\\This loame, this rough-cast, and this stone doth shew,\\\\That I am that same Wall; the truth is so.\\\\And this the cranny is, right and sinister,\\\\Through which the fearfull Louers are to whisper\\\\\\\\   Thes. Would you desire Lime and Haire to speake\\\\better?\\\\  Deme. It is the wittiest partition, that euer I heard\\\\discourse, my Lord\\\\\\\\   Thes. Pyramus drawes neere the Wall, silence.\\\\Enter Pyramus.\\\\\\\\  Pir. O grim lookt night, o night with hue so blacke,\\\\O night, which euer art, when day is not:\\\\O night, o night, alacke, alacke, alacke,\\\\I feare my Thisbies promise is forgot.\\\\And thou o wall, thou sweet and louely wall,\\\\That stands between her fathers ground and mine,\\\\Thou wall, o Wall, o sweet and louely wall,\\\\Shew me thy chinke, to blinke through with mine eine.\\\\Thankes courteous wall. Ioue shield thee well for this.\\\\But what see I? No Thisbie doe I see.\\\\O wicked wall, through whom I see no blisse,\\\\Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee\\\\\\\\   Thes. The wall me-thinkes being sensible, should\\\\curse againe\\\\\\\\   Pir. No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiuing me,\\\\Is Thisbies cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy\\\\Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall.\\\\Enter Thisbie.\\\\\\\\Pat as I told you; yonder she comes\\\\\\\\   This. O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones,\\\\For parting my faire Piramus, and me\\\\My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones;\\\\Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee\\\\\\\\   Pyra. I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke,\\\\To spy and I can heare my Thisbies face. Thisbie?\\\\  This. My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke\\\\\\\\   Pir. Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace,\\\\And like Limander am I trusty still\\\\\\\\   This. And like Helen till the Fates me kill\\\\\\\\   Pir. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true\\\\\\\\   This. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you\\\\\\\\   Pir. O kisse me through the hole of this vile wall\\\\\\\\   This. I kisse the wals hole, not your lips at all\\\\\\\\   Pir. Wilt thou at Ninnies tombe meete me straight\\\\way?\\\\  This. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay\\\\\\\\   Wall. Thus haue I Wall, my part discharged so;\\\\And being done, thus Wall away doth go.\\\\\\\\Exit Clow.\\\\\\\\  Du. Now is the morall downe between the two\\\\Neighbours\\\\\\\\   Dem. No remedie my Lord, when Wals are so wilfull,\\\\to heare without warning\\\\\\\\   Dut. This is the silliest stuffe that ere I heard\\\\\\\\   Du. The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the\\\\worst are no worse, if imagination amend them\\\\\\\\   Dut. It must be your imagination then, & not theirs\\\\\\\\   Duk. If wee imagine no worse of them then they of\\\\themselues, they may passe for excellent men. Here com\\\\two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion.\\\\Enter Lyon and Moone-shine\\\\\\\\   Lyon. You Ladies, you (whose gentle harts do feare\\\\The smallest monstrous mouse that creepes on floore)\\\\May now perchance, both quake and tremble heere,\\\\When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roare.\\\\Then know that I, one Snug the Ioyner am\\\\A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam:\\\\For if I should as Lion come in strife\\\\Into this place, 'twere pittie of my life\\\\\\\\   Du. A verie gentle beast, and of good conscience\\\\\\\\   Dem. The verie best at a beast, my Lord, y ere I saw\\\\\\\\   Lis. This Lion is a verie Fox for his valor\\\\\\\\   Du. True, and a Goose for his discretion\\\\\\\\   Dem. Not so my Lord: for his valor cannot carrie\\\\his discretion, and the fox carries the Goose\\\\\\\\   Du. His discretion I am sure cannot carrie his valor:\\\\for the Goose carries not the Fox. It is well; leaue it to\\\\his discretion, and let vs hearken to the Moone\\\\\\\\   Moone. This Lanthorne doth the horned Moone present\\\\\\\\   De. He should haue worne the hornes on his head\\\\\\\\   Du. Hee is no crescent, and his hornes are inuisible,\\\\within the circumference\\\\\\\\   Moon. This lanthorne doth the horned Moone present:\\\\My selfe, the man i'th Moone doth seeme to be\\\\\\\\   Du. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man\\\\Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it els the man\\\\i'th Moone?\\\\  Dem. He dares not come there for the candle.\\\\For you see, it is already in snuffe\\\\\\\\   Dut. I am wearie of this Moone; would he would\\\\change\\\\\\\\   Du. It appeares by his smal light of discretion, that\\\\he is in the wane: but yet in courtesie, in all reason, we\\\\must stay the time\\\\\\\\   Lys. Proceed Moone\\\\\\\\   Moon. All that I haue to say, is to tell you, that the\\\\Lanthorne is the Moone; I, the man in the Moone; this\\\\thorne bush; my thorne bush; and this dog, my dog\\\\\\\\   Dem. Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for\\\\they are in the Moone. But silence, heere comes Thisby.\\\\Enter Thisby.\\\\\\\\  This. This is old Ninnies tombe: where is my loue?\\\\  Lyon. Oh.\\\\\\\\The Lion roares, Thisby runs off.\\\\\\\\  Dem. Well roar'd Lion\\\\\\\\   Du. Well run Thisby\\\\\\\\   Dut. Well shone Moone.\\\\Truly the Moone shines with a good grace\\\\\\\\   Du. Wel mouz'd Lion\\\\\\\\   Dem. And then came Piramus\\\\\\\\   Lys. And so the Lion vanisht.\\\\Enter Piramus.\\\\\\\\  Pyr. Sweet Moone, I thank thee for thy sunny beames,\\\\I thanke thee Moone, for shining now so bright:\\\\For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beames,\\\\I trust to taste of truest Thisbies sight.\\\\But stay: O spight! but marke, poore Knight,\\\\What dreadful dole is heere?\\\\Eyes do you see! How can it be!\\\\O dainty Ducke: O Deere!\\\\Thy mantle good; what staind with blood!\\\\Approch you furies fell:\\\\O Fates! come, come: Cut thred and thrum,\\\\Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell\\\\\\\\   Du. This passion, and the death of a deare friend,\\\\Would go neere to make a man looke sad\\\\\\\\   Dut. Beshrew my heart, but I pittie the man\\\\\\\\   Pir. O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lions frame?\\\\Since lion vilde hath heere deflour'd my deere:\\\\Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame\\\\That liu'd, that lou'd, that like'd, that look'd with cheere.\\\\Come teares, confound: Out sword, and wound\\\\The pap of Piramus:\\\\I, that left pap, where heart doth hop;\\\\Thus dye I, thus, thus, thus.\\\\Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soule is in the sky,\\\\Tongue lose thy light, Moone take thy flight,\\\\Now dye, dye, dye, dye, dye\\\\\\\\   Dem. No Die, but an ace for him; for he is but one\\\\\\\\   Lis. Lesse then an ace man. For he is dead, he is nothing\\\\\\\\   Du. With the helpe of a Surgeon, he might yet recouer,\\\\and proue an Asse\\\\\\\\   Dut. How chance Moone-shine is gone before?\\\\Thisby comes backe, and findes her Louer.\\\\Enter Thisby.\\\\\\\\  Duke. She wil finde him by starre-light.\\\\Heere she comes, and her passion ends the play\\\\\\\\   Dut. Me thinkes shee should not vse a long one for\\\\such a Piramus: I hope she will be breefe\\\\\\\\   Dem. A Moth wil turne the ballance, which Piramus\\\\which Thisby is the better\\\\\\\\   Lys. She hath spyed him already, with those sweete eyes\\\\\\\\   Dem. And thus she meanes, videlicit\\\\\\\\   This. Asleepe my Loue? What, dead my Doue?\\\\O Piramus arise:\\\\Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe\\\\Must couer thy sweet eyes.\\\\These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose,\\\\These yellow Cowslip cheekes\\\\Are gone, are gone: Louers make mone:\\\\His eyes were greene as Leekes.\\\\O Sisters three, come, come to mee,\\\\With hands as pale as Milke,\\\\Lay them in gore, since you haue shore\\\\with sheeres, his thred of silke.\\\\Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword:\\\\Come blade, my brest imbrue:\\\\And farwell friends, thus Thisbie ends;\\\\Adieu, adieu, adieu\\\\\\\\   Duk. Moone-shine & Lion are left to burie the dead\\\\\\\\   Deme. I, and Wall too\\\\\\\\   Bot. No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted\\\\their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or\\\\to heare a Bergomask dance, betweene two of our company?\\\\  Duk. No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs\\\\no excuse. Neuer excuse; for when the plaiers are all\\\\dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if hee that\\\\writ it had plaid Piramus, and hung himselfe in Thisbies\\\\garter, it would haue beene a fine Tragedy: and so it is\\\\truely, and very notably discharg'd. but come, your\\\\Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone.\\\\The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelue.\\\\Louers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time.\\\\I feare we shall out-sleepe the comming morne,\\\\As much as we this night haue ouer-watcht.\\\\This palpable grosse play hath well beguil'd\\\\The heauy gate of night.

Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\\\His Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\\\From whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\\\He wants the naturall touch.

Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\\\And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\\\\\\\   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\\\  Wife. I, that he was\\\\\\\\   Son. What is a Traitor?\\\\  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\\\\\\\   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\\\\\\\   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\\\And must be hang'd\\\\\\\\   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\\\  Wife. Euery one\\\\\\\\   Son. Who must hang them?\\\\  Wife. Why, the honest men\\\\\\\\   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\\\are Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\\\and hang vp them\\\\\\\\   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\\\But how wilt thou do for a Father?\\\\  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\\\would not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\\\haue a new Father\\\\\\\\   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\\\\Enter a Messenger.\\\\\\\\  Mes.

Whether should I flye?\\\\I haue done no harme. But I remember now\\\\I am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\\\Is often laudable, to do good sometime\\\\Accounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\\\Do I put vp that womanly defence,\\\\To say I haue done no harme?\\\\What are these faces?\\\\Enter Murtherers.\\\\\\\\  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\\\  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\\\Where such as thou may'st finde him\\\\\\\\   Mur. He's a Traitor\\\\\\\\   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\\\\\\\\   Mur. What you Egge?\\\\Yong fry of Treachery?\\\\  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\\\Run away I pray you.\\\\\\\\Exit crying Murther.\\\\\\\\\\\\Scaena Tertia.\\\\\\\\Enter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\\\\\\\  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\\\Weepe our sad bosomes empty\\\\\\\\   Macd. Let vs rather\\\\Hold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\\\Bestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\\\New Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\\\Strike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\\\As if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\\\Like Syllable of Dolour\\\\\\\\   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\\\What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\\\As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\\\What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\\\This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\\\Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\\\He hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\\\You may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\\\To offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\\\T' appease an angry God\\\\\\\\   Macd. I am not treacherous\\\\\\\\   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\\\A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\\\In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\\\That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\\\Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\\\Though all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\\\Yet Grace must still looke so\\\\\\\\   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\\\\\\\   Malc. Perchance euen there\\\\Where I did finde my doubts.\\\\Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\\\Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\\\Without leaue-taking. I pray you,\\\\Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\\\But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\\\What euer I shall thinke\\\\\\\\   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\\\Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\\\For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\\\The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\\\I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\\\For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\\\And the rich East to boot\\\\\\\\   Mal. Be not offended:\\\\I speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\\\I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\\\It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\\\Is added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\\\There would be hands vplifted in my right:\\\\And heere from gracious England haue I offer\\\\Of goodly thousands. But for all this,\\\\When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\\\Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\\\Shall haue more vices then it had before,\\\\More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\\\By him that shall succeede\\\\\\\\   Macd. What should he be?\\\\  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\\\All the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\\\That when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\\\Will seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\\\Esteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\\\With my confinelesse harmes\\\\\\\\   Macd. Not in the Legions\\\\Of horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\\\In euils, to top Macbeth\\\\\\\\   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\\\Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\\\Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\\\That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\\\In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\\\Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\\\The Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\\\All continent Impediments would ore-beare\\\\That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\\\Then such an one to reigne\\\\\\\\   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\\\In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\\\Th' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\\\And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\\\To take vpon you what is yours: you may\\\\Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\\\And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\\\We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\\\That Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\\\As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\\\Finding it so inclinde\\\\\\\\   Mal. With this, there growes\\\\In my most ill-composd Affection, such\\\\A stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\\\I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\\\Desire his Iewels, and this others House,\\\\And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\\\To make me hunger more, that I should forge\\\\Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\\\Destroying them for wealth\\\\\\\\   Macd. This Auarice\\\\stickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\\\Then Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\\\The Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\\\Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\\\Of your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\\\With other Graces weigh'd\\\\\\\\   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\\\As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\\\Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\\\Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\\\I haue no rellish of them, but abound\\\\In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\\\Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\\\Poure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\\\Vprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\\\All vnity on earth\\\\\\\\   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\\\\\\\   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\\\I am as I haue spoken\\\\\\\\   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\\\With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\\\When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\\\Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\\\By his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\\\And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\\\Was a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\\\Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\\\Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\\\These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\\\Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\\\Thy hope ends heere\\\\\\\\   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\\\Childe of integrity, hath from my soule\\\\Wip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\\\To thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\\\By many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\\\Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\\\From ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\\\Deale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\\\I put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\\\Vnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\\\The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\\\For strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\\\Vnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\\\Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\\\At no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\\\The Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\\\No lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\\\Was this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\\\Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\\\Whither indeed, before they heere approach\\\\Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\\\Already at a point, was setting foorth:\\\\Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\\\Be like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\\\  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\\\'Tis hard to reconcile.\\\\Enter a Doctor.\\\\\\\\  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\\\I pray you?\\\\  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules\\\\That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\\\The great assay of Art. But at his touch,\\\\Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\\\They presently amend.\\\\Enter.\\\\\\\\  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\\\\\\\   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\\\\  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\\\\A most myraculous worke in this good King,\\\\Which often since my heere remaine in England,\\\\I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\\\Himselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people\\\\All swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,\\\\The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\\\Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,\\\\Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\\\\To the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\\\The healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,\\\\He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\\\And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\\\That speake him full of Grace.\\\\Enter Rosse.\\\\\\\\  Macd. See who comes heere\\\\\\\\   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\\\\\\\   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\\\\\\\   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\\\The meanes that makes vs Strangers\\\\\\\\   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\\\\\\\   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\\\  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\\\Almost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\\\Be call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\\\But who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\\\Where sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\\\Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\\\A Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\\\Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\\\Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\\\Dying, or ere they sicken\\\\\\\\   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\\\\\\\   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\\\  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\\\Each minute teemes a new one\\\\\\\\   Macd. How do's my Wife?\\\\  Rosse. Why well\\\\\\\\   Macd. And all my Children?\\\\  Rosse. Well too\\\\\\\\   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?\\\\  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\\\  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\\\  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\\\Which I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\\\Of many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\\\Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\\\For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\\\Now is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\\\Would create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\\\To doffe their dire distresses\\\\\\\\   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\\\We are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\\\Lent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\\\An older, and a better Souldier, none\\\\That Christendome giues out\\\\\\\\   Rosse. Would I could answer\\\\This comfort with the like. But I haue words\\\\That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\\\Where hearing should not latch them\\\\\\\\   Macd. What concerne they,\\\\The generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\\\Due to some single brest?\\\\  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\\\But in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\\\Pertaines to you alone\\\\\\\\   Macd. If it be mine\\\\Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\\\\\\\   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\\\Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\\\that euer yet they heard\\\\\\\\   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\\\\\\\   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\\\Sauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\\\Were on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\\\To adde the death of you\\\\\\\\   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\\\What man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\\\Giue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\\\Whispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\\\\\\\   Macd. My Children too?\\\\  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found\\\\\\\\   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?\\\\  Rosse. I haue said\\\\\\\\   Malc. Be comforted.\\\\Let's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,\\\\To cure this deadly greefe\\\\\\\\   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?\\\\Did you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?\\\\What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme\\\\At one fell swoope?\\\\  Malc. Dispute it like a man\\\\\\\\   Macd. I shall do so:\\\\But I must also feele it as a man;\\\\I cannot but remember such things were\\\\That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,\\\\And would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,\\\\They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,\\\\Not for their owne demerits, but for mine\\\\Fell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now\\\\\\\\   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe\\\\Conuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it\\\\\\\\   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\\\And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,\\\\Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,\\\\Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe\\\\Within my Swords length set him, if he scape\\\\Heauen forgiue him too\\\\\\\\   Mal. This time goes manly:\\\\Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,\\\\Our lacke is nothing but our leaue.

As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed\\\\    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,\\\\    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there\\\\    begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and\\\\    report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me\\\\    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at\\\\    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my\\\\    birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are\\\\    bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,\\\\    they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly\\\\    hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for\\\\    the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him\\\\    as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the\\\\    something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from\\\\    me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a\\\\    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my\\\\    education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of\\\\    my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against\\\\    this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no\\\\    wise remedy how to avoid it.\\\\\\\\                           Enter OLIVER\\\\\\\\\\\\  ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me\\\\    up.                                           [ADAM retires]\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a\\\\    poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What\\\\    prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are\\\\    my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you\\\\    should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better\\\\    in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not\\\\    away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as\\\\    much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming\\\\    before me is nearer to his reverence.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. What, boy!                               [Strikes him]\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de\\\\    Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such\\\\    a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not\\\\    take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy\\\\    tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.\\\\\\\\  ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's\\\\    remembrance, be at accord.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Let me go, I say.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father\\\\    charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have\\\\    train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all\\\\    gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in\\\\    me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such\\\\    exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor\\\\    allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy\\\\    my fortunes.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,\\\\    get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have\\\\    some part of your will. I pray you leave me.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.\\\\\\\\  ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in\\\\    your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke\\\\    such a word.\\\\                                         Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic\\\\    your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither.\\\\    Holla, Dennis!\\\\\\\\                          Enter DENNIS\\\\\\\\\\\\  DENNIS. Calls your worship?\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?\\\\\\\\  DENNIS. So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access\\\\    to you.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and\\\\    to-morrow the wrestling is.\\\\\\\\                          Enter CHARLES\\\\\\\\\\\\  CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new\\\\    court?\\\\\\\\  CHARLES. There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that\\\\    is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;\\\\    and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary\\\\    exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;\\\\    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished\\\\    with her father?\\\\\\\\  CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,\\\\    being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have\\\\    followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at\\\\    the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own\\\\    daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?\\\\\\\\  CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many\\\\    merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood\\\\    of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,\\\\    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?\\\\\\\\  CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a\\\\    matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger\\\\    brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against\\\\    me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he\\\\    that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.\\\\    Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would\\\\    be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come\\\\    in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint\\\\    you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,\\\\    or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is\\\\    thing of his own search and altogether against my will.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt\\\\    find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my\\\\    brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to\\\\    dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,\\\\    Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of\\\\    ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret\\\\    and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.\\\\    Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his\\\\    neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou\\\\    dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace\\\\    himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap\\\\    thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he\\\\    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I\\\\    assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one\\\\    so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly\\\\    of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush\\\\    and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.\\\\\\\\  CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come\\\\    to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,\\\\    I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!\\\\\\\\ Exit\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester.\\\\    I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,\\\\    hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and\\\\    yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly\\\\    beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and\\\\    especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am\\\\    altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler\\\\    shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy\\\\    thither, which now I'll go about.

I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and\\\\    would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget\\\\    a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any\\\\    extraordinary pleasure.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I\\\\    love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy\\\\    uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me,\\\\    I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst\\\\    thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd\\\\    as mine is to thee.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to\\\\    rejoice in yours.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to\\\\    have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what\\\\    he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee\\\\    again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that\\\\    oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear\\\\    Rose, be merry.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.\\\\    Let me see; what think you of falling in love?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man\\\\    in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety\\\\    of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her\\\\    wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily\\\\    misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her\\\\    gifts to women.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes\\\\    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very\\\\    ill-favouredly.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:\\\\    Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of\\\\    Nature.\\\\\\\\                         Enter TOUCHSTONE\\\\\\\\\\\\  CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by\\\\    Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to\\\\    flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off\\\\    the argument?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when\\\\    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but\\\\    Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of\\\\    such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for\\\\    always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.\\\\    How now, wit! Whither wander you?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Were you made the messenger?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were\\\\    good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.\\\\    Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard\\\\    was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear\\\\    by your beards that I am a knave.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you\\\\    swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this\\\\    knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he\\\\    had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or\\\\    that mustard.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no\\\\    more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise\\\\    men do foolishly.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that\\\\    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have\\\\    makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.\\\\\\\\                           Enter LE BEAU\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,\\\\    Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Sport! of what colour?\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good\\\\    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your\\\\    ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and\\\\    here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by\\\\    these presents'-\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's\\\\    wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of\\\\    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd\\\\    the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,\\\\    their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the\\\\    beholders take his part with weeping.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Alas!\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have\\\\    lost?\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time\\\\    that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Or I, I promise thee.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in\\\\    his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?\\\\    Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place\\\\    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.\\\\\\\\           Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,\\\\                     CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS\\\\\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own\\\\    peril on his forwardness.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Is yonder the man?\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. Even he, madam.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to\\\\    see the wrestling?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,\\\\\\\\    there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth\\\\    I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.\\\\    Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.\\\\                                     [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come\\\\    but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.\\\\    You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw\\\\    yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the\\\\    fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal\\\\    enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own\\\\    safety and give over this attempt.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be\\\\    misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the\\\\    wrestling might not go forward.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,\\\\    wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent\\\\    ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go\\\\    with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one\\\\    sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is\\\\    willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none\\\\    to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only\\\\    in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when\\\\    I have made it empty.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with\\\\    you.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Your heart's desires be with you!\\\\\\\\  CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to\\\\    lie with his mother earth?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. You shall try but one fall.\\\\\\\\  CHARLES. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a\\\\    second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me\\\\    before; but come your ways.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the\\\\    leg.                                          [They wrestle]\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O excellent young man!\\\\\\\\  CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should\\\\    down.\\\\                                      [CHARLES is thrown. Shout]\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. No more, no more.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de\\\\    Boys.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.\\\\    The world esteem'd thy father honourable,\\\\    But I did find him still mine enemy.\\\\    Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,\\\\    Hadst thou descended from another house.\\\\    But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;\\\\    I would thou hadst told me of another father.\\\\                                 Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,\\\\    His youngest son- and would not change that calling\\\\    To be adopted heir to Frederick.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,\\\\    And all the world was of my father's mind;\\\\    Had I before known this young man his son,\\\\    I should have given him tears unto entreaties\\\\    Ere he should thus have ventur'd.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Gentle cousin,\\\\    Let us go thank him, and encourage him;\\\\    My father's rough and envious disposition\\\\    Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserv'd;\\\\    If you do keep your promises in love\\\\    But justly as you have exceeded all promise,\\\\    Your mistress shall be happy.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]\\\\    Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,\\\\    That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.\\\\    Shall we go, coz?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts\\\\    Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up\\\\    Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;\\\\    I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?\\\\    Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown\\\\    More than your enemies.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Will you go, coz?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Have with you. Fare you well.\\\\                                       Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?\\\\    I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.\\\\    O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!\\\\    Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.\\\\\\\\                      Re-enter LE BEAU\\\\\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you\\\\    To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd\\\\    High commendation, true applause, and love,\\\\    Yet such is now the Duke's condition\\\\    That he misconstrues all that you have done.\\\\    The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,\\\\    More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:\\\\    Which of the two was daughter of the Duke\\\\    That here was at the wrestling?\\\\\\\\  LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;\\\\    But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;\\\\    The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,\\\\    And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,\\\\    To keep his daughter company; whose loves\\\\    Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.\\\\    But I can tell you that of late this Duke\\\\    Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,\\\\    Grounded upon no other argument\\\\    But that the people praise her for her virtues\\\\    And pity her for her good father's sake;\\\\    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady\\\\    Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.\\\\    Hereafter, in a better world than this,\\\\    I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.\\\\                                                    Exit LE BEAU\\\\    Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;\\\\    From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.\\\\    But heavenly Rosalind!                                  Exit\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE III.\\\\\\\\The DUKE's palace\\\\\\\\Enter CELIA and ROSALIND\\\\\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!\\\\    Not a word?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;\\\\    throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should\\\\    be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. But is all this for your father?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of\\\\    briers is this working-day world!\\\\\\\\  CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday\\\\    foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats\\\\    will catch them.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my\\\\    heart.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Hem them away.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of\\\\    a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in\\\\    good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall\\\\    into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?\\\\    By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his\\\\    father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?\\\\\\\\                    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I\\\\    do. Look, here comes the Duke.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,\\\\    And get you from our court.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Me, uncle?\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. You, cousin.\\\\    Within these ten days if that thou beest found\\\\    So near our public court as twenty miles,\\\\    Thou diest for it.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace,\\\\    Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.\\\\    If with myself I hold intelligence,\\\\    Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;\\\\    If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-\\\\    As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,\\\\    Never so much as in a thought unborn\\\\    Did I offend your Highness.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. Thus do all traitors;\\\\    If their purgation did consist in words,\\\\    They are as innocent as grace itself.\\\\    Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.\\\\    Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;\\\\    So was I when your Highness banish'd him.\\\\    Treason is not inherited, my lord;\\\\    Or, if we did derive it from our friends,\\\\    What's that to me? My father was no traitor.\\\\    Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much\\\\    To think my poverty is treacherous.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,\\\\    Else had she with her father rang'd along.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;\\\\    It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;\\\\    I was too young that time to value her,\\\\    But now I know her. If she be a traitor,\\\\    Why so am I: we still have slept together,\\\\    Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;\\\\    And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,\\\\    Still we went coupled and inseparable.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,\\\\    Her very silence and her patience,\\\\    Speak to the people, and they pity her.\\\\    Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;\\\\    And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous\\\\    When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.\\\\    Firm and irrevocable is my doom\\\\    Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;\\\\    I cannot live out of her company.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.\\\\    If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,\\\\    And in the greatness of my word, you die.\\\\                                           Exeunt DUKE and LORDS\\\\\\\\  CELIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?\\\\    Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.\\\\    I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I have more cause.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin.\\\\    Prithee be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke\\\\    Hath banish'd me, his daughter?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. That he hath not.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love\\\\    Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.\\\\    Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?\\\\    No; let my father seek another heir.\\\\    Therefore devise with me how we may fly,\\\\    Whither to go, and what to bear with us;\\\\    And do not seek to take your charge upon you,\\\\    To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;\\\\    For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,\\\\    Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,\\\\    Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!\\\\    Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,\\\\    And with a kind of umber smirch my face;\\\\    The like do you; so shall we pass along,\\\\    And never stir assailants.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Were it not better,\\\\    Because that I am more than common tall,\\\\    That I did suit me all points like a man?\\\\    A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,\\\\    A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart\\\\    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-\\\\    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,\\\\    As many other mannish cowards have\\\\    That do outface it with their semblances.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,\\\\    And therefore look you call me Ganymede.\\\\    But what will you be call'd?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:\\\\    No longer Celia, but Aliena.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal\\\\    The clownish fool out of your father's court?\\\\    Would he not be a comfort to our travel?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;\\\\    Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,\\\\    And get our jewels and our wealth together;\\\\    Devise the fittest time and safest way\\\\    To hide us from pursuit that will be made\\\\    After my flight. Now go we in content\\\\    To liberty, and not to banishment.

Come, shall we go and kill us venison?\\\\    And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,\\\\    Being native burghers of this desert city,\\\\    Should, in their own confines, with forked heads\\\\    Have their round haunches gor'd.\\\\\\\\  FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord,\\\\    The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;\\\\    And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp\\\\    Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.\\\\    To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself\\\\    Did steal behind him as he lay along\\\\    Under an oak whose antique root peeps out\\\\    Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!\\\\    To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,\\\\    That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,\\\\    Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,\\\\    The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans\\\\    That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat\\\\    Almost to bursting; and the big round tears\\\\    Cours'd one another down his innocent nose\\\\    In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,\\\\    Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,\\\\    Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,\\\\    Augmenting it with tears.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?\\\\    Did he not moralize this spectacle?\\\\\\\\  FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.\\\\    First, for his weeping into the needless stream:\\\\    'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament\\\\    As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more\\\\    To that which had too much.' Then, being there alone,\\\\    Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:\\\\    ''Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part\\\\    The flux of company.' Anon, a careless herd,\\\\    Full of the pasture, jumps along by him\\\\    And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques\\\\    'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;\\\\    'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look\\\\    Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'\\\\    Thus most invectively he pierceth through\\\\    The body of the country, city, court,\\\\    Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we\\\\    Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,\\\\    To fright the animals, and to kill them up\\\\    In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?\\\\\\\\  SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting\\\\    Upon the sobbing deer.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place;\\\\    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,\\\\    For then he's full of matter.\\\\\\\\  FIRST LORD. I'll bring you to him straight.

Can it be possible that no man saw them?\\\\    It cannot be; some villains of my court\\\\    Are of consent and sufferance in this.\\\\\\\\  FIRST LORD. I cannot hear of any that did see her.\\\\    The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,\\\\    Saw her abed, and in the morning early\\\\    They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.\\\\\\\\  SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft\\\\    Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.\\\\    Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,\\\\    Confesses that she secretly o'erheard\\\\    Your daughter and her cousin much commend\\\\    The parts and graces of the wrestler\\\\    That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;\\\\    And she believes, wherever they are gone,\\\\    That youth is surely in their company.\\\\\\\\  FREDERICK.

O my gentle master!\\\\    O my sweet master! O you memory\\\\    Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?\\\\    Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?\\\\    And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?\\\\    Why would you be so fond to overcome\\\\    The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?\\\\    Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.\\\\    Know you not, master, to some kind of men\\\\    Their graces serve them but as enemies?\\\\    No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,\\\\    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.\\\\    O, what a world is this, when what is comely\\\\    Envenoms him that bears it!\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Why, what's the matter?\\\\\\\\  ADAM. O unhappy youth!\\\\    Come not within these doors; within this roof\\\\    The enemy of all your graces lives.\\\\    Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-\\\\    Yet not the son; I will not call him son\\\\    Of him I was about to call his father-\\\\    Hath heard your praises; and this night he means\\\\    To burn the lodging where you use to lie,\\\\    And you within it. If he fail of that,\\\\    He will have other means to cut you off;\\\\    I overheard him and his practices.\\\\    This is no place; this house is but a butchery;\\\\    Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?\\\\\\\\  ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,\\\\    Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce\\\\    A thievish living on the common road?\\\\    This I must do, or know not what to do;\\\\    Yet this I will not do, do how I can.\\\\    I rather will subject me to the malice\\\\    Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.\\\\\\\\  ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,\\\\    The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,\\\\    Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,\\\\    When service should in my old limbs lie lame,\\\\    And unregarded age in corners thrown.\\\\    Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,\\\\    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,\\\\    Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;\\\\    All this I give you. Let me be your servant;\\\\    Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;\\\\    For in my youth I never did apply\\\\    Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,\\\\    Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo\\\\    The means of weakness and debility;\\\\    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,\\\\    Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;\\\\    I'll do the service of a younger man\\\\    In all your business and necessities.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appears\\\\    The constant service of the antique world,\\\\    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!\\\\    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,\\\\    Where none will sweat but for promotion,\\\\    And having that do choke their service up\\\\    Even with the having; it is not so with thee.\\\\    But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree\\\\    That cannot so much as a blossom yield\\\\    In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.\\\\    But come thy ways, we'll go along together,\\\\    And ere we have thy youthful wages spent\\\\    We'll light upon some settled low content.\\\\\\\\  ADAM.

Exeunt\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE IV.\\\\\\\\The Forest of Arden\\\\\\\\Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,\\\\    and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as\\\\    doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat;\\\\    therefore, courage, good Aliena.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;\\\\    yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you; for I think you\\\\    have no money in your purse.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at\\\\    home I was in a better place; but travellers must be content.\\\\\\\\                        Enter CORIN and SILVIUS\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a\\\\    young man and an old in solemn talk.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!\\\\\\\\  CORIN. I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,\\\\    Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover\\\\    As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.\\\\    But if thy love were ever like to mine,\\\\    As sure I think did never man love so,\\\\    How many actions most ridiculous\\\\    Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily!\\\\    If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly\\\\    That ever love did make thee run into,\\\\    Thou hast not lov'd;\\\\    Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,\\\\    Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,\\\\    Thou hast not lov'd;\\\\    Or if thou hast not broke from company\\\\    Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,\\\\    Thou hast not lov'd.\\\\    O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,\\\\    I have by hard adventure found mine own.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my\\\\    sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to\\\\    Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the\\\\    cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember\\\\    the wooing of peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods,\\\\    and giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these\\\\    for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers;\\\\    but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal\\\\    in folly.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break\\\\    my shins against it.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion\\\\    Is much upon my fashion.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows something stale with me.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man\\\\    If he for gold will give us any food;\\\\    I faint almost to death.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Holla, you clown!\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Who calls?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Your betters, sir.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Else are they very wretched.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold\\\\    Can in this desert place buy entertainment,\\\\    Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.\\\\    Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,\\\\    And faints for succour.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Fair sir, I pity her,\\\\    And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,\\\\    My fortunes were more able to relieve her;\\\\    But I am shepherd to another man,\\\\    And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.\\\\    My master is of churlish disposition,\\\\    And little recks to find the way to heaven\\\\    By doing deeds of hospitality.\\\\    Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,\\\\    Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,\\\\    By reason of his absence, there is nothing\\\\    That you will feed on; but what is, come see,\\\\    And in my voice most welcome shall you be.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?\\\\\\\\  CORIN. That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,\\\\    That little cares for buying any thing.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,\\\\    Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,\\\\    And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,\\\\    And willingly could waste my time in it.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Assuredly the thing is to be sold.\\\\    Go with me; if you like upon report\\\\    The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,\\\\    I will your very faithful feeder be,\\\\    And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.\\\\    Come, more; another stanzo. Call you 'em stanzos?\\\\\\\\  AMIENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing.\\\\    Will you sing?\\\\\\\\  AMIENS. More at your request than to please myself.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but\\\\    that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes;\\\\    and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a\\\\    penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks.

He saves my labour by his own approach.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,\\\\    That your poor friends must woo your company?\\\\    What, you look merrily!\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,\\\\    A motley fool. A miserable world!\\\\    As I do live by food, I met a fool,\\\\    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,\\\\    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,\\\\    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.\\\\    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,\\\\    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'\\\\    And then he drew a dial from his poke,\\\\    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,\\\\    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;\\\\    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;\\\\    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;\\\\    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;\\\\    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,\\\\    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;\\\\    And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear\\\\    The motley fool thus moral on the time,\\\\    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer\\\\    That fools should be so deep contemplative;\\\\    And I did laugh sans intermission\\\\    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!\\\\    A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,\\\\    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,\\\\    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,\\\\    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit\\\\    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd\\\\    With observation, the which he vents\\\\    In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!\\\\    I am ambitious for a motley coat.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. It is my only suit,\\\\    Provided that you weed your better judgments\\\\    Of all opinion that grows rank in them\\\\    That I am wise. I must have liberty\\\\    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,\\\\    To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;\\\\    And they that are most galled with my folly,\\\\    They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?\\\\    The why is plain as way to parish church:\\\\    He that a fool doth very wisely hit\\\\    Doth very foolishly, although he smart,\\\\    Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,\\\\    The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd\\\\    Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.\\\\    Invest me in my motley; give me leave\\\\    To speak my mind, and I will through and through\\\\    Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,\\\\    If they will patiently receive my medicine.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;\\\\    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,\\\\    As sensual as the brutish sting itself;\\\\    And all th' embossed sores and headed evils\\\\    That thou with license of free foot hast caught\\\\    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride\\\\    That can therein tax any private party?\\\\    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,\\\\    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?\\\\    What woman in the city do I name\\\\    When that I say the city-woman bears\\\\    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?\\\\    Who can come in and say that I mean her,\\\\    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?\\\\    Or what is he of basest function\\\\    That says his bravery is not on my cost,\\\\    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits\\\\    His folly to the mettle of my speech?\\\\    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein\\\\    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,\\\\    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,\\\\    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,\\\\    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?\\\\\\\\             Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn\\\\\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?\\\\    Or else a rude despiser of good manners,\\\\    That in civility thou seem'st so empty?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point\\\\    Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show\\\\    Of smooth civility; yet arn I inland bred,\\\\    And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;\\\\    He dies that touches any of this fruit\\\\    Till I and my affairs are answered.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force\\\\    More than your force move us to gentleness.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;\\\\    I thought that all things had been savage here,\\\\    And therefore put I on the countenance\\\\    Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are\\\\    That in this desert inaccessible,\\\\    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,\\\\    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;\\\\    If ever you have look'd on better days,\\\\    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,\\\\    If ever sat at any good man's feast,\\\\    If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,\\\\    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,\\\\    Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;\\\\    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,\\\\    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,\\\\    And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes\\\\    Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;\\\\    And therefore sit you down in gentleness,\\\\    And take upon command what help we have\\\\    That to your wanting may be minist'red.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,\\\\    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,\\\\    And give it food. There is an old poor man\\\\    Who after me hath many a weary step\\\\    Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,\\\\    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,\\\\    I will not touch a bit.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out.\\\\    And we will nothing waste till you return.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!\\\\ Exit\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:\\\\    This wide and universal theatre\\\\    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene\\\\    Wherein we play in.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. All the world's a stage,\\\\    And all the men and women merely players;\\\\    They have their exits and their entrances;\\\\    And one man in his time plays many parts,\\\\    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,\\\\    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;\\\\    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel\\\\    And shining morning face, creeping like snail\\\\    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,\\\\    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\\\\    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\\\\    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,\\\\    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\\\\    Seeking the bubble reputation\\\\    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\\\\    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,\\\\    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\\\\    Full of wise saws and modern instances;\\\\    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\\\\    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,\\\\    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\\\\    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide\\\\    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,\\\\    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes\\\\    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\\\\    That ends this strange eventful history,\\\\    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;\\\\    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.\\\\\\\\                  Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM\\\\\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR.

Sir, sir, that cannot be.\\\\    But were I not the better part made mercy,\\\\    I should not seek an absent argument\\\\    Of my revenge, thou present.

Exeunt\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE II.\\\\\\\\The forest\\\\\\\\Enter ORLANDO, with a paper\\\\\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;\\\\    And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey\\\\    With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,\\\\    Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.\\\\    O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,\\\\    And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,\\\\    That every eye which in this forest looks\\\\    Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.\\\\    Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,\\\\    The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.             Exit\\\\\\\\                     Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE\\\\\\\\\\\\  CORIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good\\\\    life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.\\\\    In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in\\\\    respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in\\\\    respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect\\\\    it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life,\\\\    look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty\\\\    in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in\\\\    thee, shepherd?\\\\\\\\  CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at\\\\    ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is\\\\    without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,\\\\    and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a\\\\    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath\\\\    learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,\\\\    or comes of a very dull kindred.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in\\\\    court, shepherd?\\\\\\\\  CORIN. No, truly.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Nay, I hope.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on\\\\    one side.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good\\\\    manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must\\\\    be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art\\\\    in a parlous state, shepherd.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the\\\\    court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the\\\\    country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not\\\\    at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be\\\\    uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you\\\\    know, are greasy.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the\\\\    grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?\\\\    Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.\\\\    A more sounder instance; come.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our\\\\    sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are\\\\    perfum'd with civet.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good\\\\    piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is\\\\    of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat.\\\\    Mend the instance, shepherd.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man!\\\\    God make incision in thee! thou art raw.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I\\\\    wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other\\\\    men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is\\\\    to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes\\\\    and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the\\\\    copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray\\\\    a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,\\\\    out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this,\\\\    the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how\\\\    thou shouldst scape.\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.\\\\\\\\                  Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND.   'From the east to western Inde,\\\\              No jewel is like Rosalinde.\\\\              Her worth, being mounted on the wind,\\\\              Through all the world bears Rosalinde.\\\\              All the pictures fairest lin'd\\\\              Are but black to Rosalinde.\\\\              Let no face be kept in mind\\\\              But the fair of Rosalinde.'\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and\\\\    suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted. It is the right\\\\    butter-women's rank to market.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Out, fool!\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE.   For a taste:\\\\                If a hart do lack a hind,\\\\                Let him seek out Rosalinde.\\\\                If the cat will after kind,\\\\                So be sure will Rosalinde.\\\\                Winter garments must be lin'd,\\\\                So must slender Rosalinde.\\\\                They that reap must sheaf and bind,\\\\                Then to cart with Rosalinde.\\\\                Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,\\\\                Such a nut is Rosalinde.\\\\                He that sweetest rose will find\\\\                Must find love's prick and Rosalinde.\\\\    This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect\\\\    yourself with them?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a\\\\    medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for\\\\    you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right\\\\    virtue of the medlar.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest\\\\    judge.\\\\\\\\                      Enter CELIA, with a writing\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Peace!\\\\    Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.\\\\\\\\  CELIA.   'Why should this a desert be?\\\\             For it is unpeopled? No;\\\\           Tongues I'll hang on every tree\\\\             That shall civil sayings show.\\\\           Some, how brief the life of man\\\\             Runs his erring pilgrimage,\\\\           That the streching of a span\\\\             Buckles in his sum of age;\\\\           Some, of violated vows\\\\             'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;\\\\           But upon the fairest boughs,\\\\             Or at every sentence end,\\\\           Will I Rosalinda write,\\\\             Teaching all that read to know\\\\           The quintessence of every sprite\\\\             Heaven would in little show.\\\\           Therefore heaven Nature charg'd\\\\             That one body should be fill'd\\\\           With all graces wide-enlarg'd.\\\\             Nature presently distill'd\\\\           Helen's cheek, but not her heart,\\\\             Cleopatra's majesty,\\\\           Atalanta's better part,\\\\             Sad Lucretia's modesty.\\\\           Thus Rosalinde of many parts\\\\             By heavenly synod was devis'd,\\\\           Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,\\\\             To have the touches dearest priz'd.\\\\           Heaven would that she these gifts should have,\\\\           And I to live and die her slave.'\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have\\\\    you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have\\\\    patience, good people.'\\\\\\\\  CELIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with\\\\    him, sirrah.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;\\\\\\\\    though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.\\\\                                     Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them\\\\    had in them more feet than the verses would bear.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves\\\\    without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be\\\\    hang'd and carved upon these trees?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you\\\\    came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so\\\\    berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat,\\\\    which I can hardly remember.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Trow you who hath done this?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Is it a man?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.\\\\    Change you colour?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I prithee, who?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but\\\\    mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Is it possible?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell\\\\    me who it is.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet\\\\    again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am\\\\    caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my\\\\    disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.\\\\    I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would\\\\    thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man\\\\    out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-\\\\    either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork\\\\    out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?\\\\    Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful.\\\\    Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the\\\\    knowledge of his chin.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels\\\\    and your heart both in an instant.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true\\\\    maid.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Orlando?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Orlando.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?\\\\    What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?\\\\    Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where\\\\    remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him\\\\    again? Answer me in one word.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too\\\\    great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these\\\\    particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's\\\\    apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the\\\\    propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and\\\\    relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a\\\\    dropp'd acorn.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth\\\\    such fruit.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Proceed.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes\\\\    the ground.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets\\\\    unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out\\\\    of tune.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.\\\\    Sweet, say on.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?\\\\\\\\                   Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as\\\\    lief have been myself alone.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too\\\\    for your society.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in\\\\    their barks.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them\\\\    ill-favouredly.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Yes, just.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. I do not like her name.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was\\\\    christen'd.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. What stature is she of?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been\\\\    acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence\\\\    you have studied your questions.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's\\\\    heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against\\\\    our mistress the world, and all our misery.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against\\\\    whom I know most faults.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am\\\\    weary of you.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see\\\\    him.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. There I shall see mine own figure.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur\\\\    Melancholy.\\\\                                                     Exit JAQUES\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,\\\\    and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,\\\\    forester?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Very well; what would you?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in\\\\    the forest.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing\\\\    every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot\\\\    of Time as well as a clock.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as\\\\    proper?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with\\\\    divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time\\\\    trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still\\\\    withal.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the\\\\    contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the\\\\    interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems\\\\    the length of seven year.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath\\\\    not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,\\\\    and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one\\\\    lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other\\\\    knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles\\\\    withal.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly\\\\    as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Who stays it still withal?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term\\\\    and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of\\\\    the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Are you native of this place?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in\\\\    so removed a dwelling.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious\\\\    uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland\\\\    man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.\\\\    I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I\\\\    am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he\\\\    hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid\\\\    to the charge of women?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another\\\\    as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his\\\\    fellow-fault came to match it.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of them.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are\\\\    sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young\\\\    plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon\\\\    hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the\\\\    name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give\\\\    him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love\\\\    upon him.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your\\\\    remedy.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me\\\\    how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you\\\\    are not prisoner.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. What were his marks?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,\\\\    which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;\\\\    a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,\\\\    for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.\\\\    Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your\\\\    sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you\\\\    demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you\\\\    are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself\\\\    than seeming the lover of any other.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love\\\\    believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess\\\\    she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give\\\\    the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that\\\\    hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I\\\\    am that he, that unfortunate he.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as\\\\    well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why\\\\    they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so\\\\    ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing\\\\    it by counsel.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his\\\\    love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which\\\\    time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,\\\\    changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,\\\\    shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every\\\\    passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and\\\\    women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like\\\\    him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now\\\\    weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his\\\\    mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to\\\\    forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook\\\\    merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take\\\\    upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,\\\\    that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and\\\\    come every day to my cote and woo me.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,\\\\    you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you\\\\    go?                                                   Exeunt\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE III.\\\\\\\\The forest\\\\\\\\Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind\\\\\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,\\\\    Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature\\\\    content you?\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most\\\\    capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a\\\\    thatch'd house!\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's\\\\    good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it\\\\    strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.\\\\    Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and\\\\    word? Is it a true thing?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,\\\\    and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may\\\\    be said as lovers they do feign.\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;\\\\    now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst\\\\    feign.\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty\\\\    coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me\\\\    honest.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were\\\\    to put good meat into an unclean dish.\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;\\\\    sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will\\\\    marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,\\\\    the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in\\\\    this place of the forest, and to couple us.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger\\\\    in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no\\\\    assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are\\\\    odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end\\\\    of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end\\\\    of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his\\\\    own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest\\\\    deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore\\\\    blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so\\\\    is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare\\\\    brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no\\\\    skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes\\\\    Sir Oliver.\\\\\\\\                       Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT\\\\\\\\    Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here\\\\    under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?\\\\\\\\  MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.\\\\\\\\  MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?\\\\    You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am\\\\    very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be\\\\    cover'd.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and\\\\    the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons\\\\    bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married\\\\    under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good\\\\    priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but\\\\    join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will\\\\    prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be\\\\    married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me\\\\    well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me\\\\    hereafter to leave my wife.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;\\\\    We must be married or we must live in bawdry.\\\\    Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-\\\\               O sweet Oliver,\\\\               O brave Oliver,\\\\           Leave me not behind thee.\\\\    But-\\\\                 Wind away,\\\\               Begone, I say,\\\\           I will not to wedding with thee.\\\\                           Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY\\\\\\\\  MARTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all\\\\    shall flout me out of my calling.                       Exit\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE IV.\\\\\\\\The forest\\\\\\\\Enter ROSALIND and CELIA\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears\\\\    do not become a man.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.\\\\    Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of\\\\    holy bread.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of\\\\    winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of\\\\    chastity is in them.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and\\\\    comes not?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Do you think so?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but\\\\    for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered\\\\    goblet or a worm-eaten nut.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Not true in love?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no\\\\    stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer\\\\    of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke,\\\\    your father.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.\\\\    He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as\\\\    he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when\\\\    there is such a man as Orlando?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave\\\\    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite\\\\    traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that\\\\    spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble\\\\    goose. But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides.\\\\    Who comes here?\\\\\\\\                         Enter CORIN\\\\\\\\\\\\  CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired\\\\    After the shepherd that complain'd of love,\\\\    Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,\\\\    Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess\\\\    That was his mistress.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Well, and what of him?\\\\\\\\  CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd\\\\    Between the pale complexion of true love\\\\    And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,\\\\    Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,\\\\    If you will mark it.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!\\\\    The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.\\\\    Bring us to this sight, and you shall say\\\\    I'll prove a busy actor in their play.                Exeunt\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE V.\\\\\\\\Another part of the forest\\\\\\\\Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE\\\\\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.\\\\    Say that you love me not; but say not so\\\\    In bitterness. The common executioner,\\\\    Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,\\\\    Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck\\\\    But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be\\\\    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?\\\\\\\\          Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance\\\\\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner;\\\\    I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.\\\\    Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.\\\\    'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,\\\\    That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,\\\\    Who shut their coward gates on atomies,\\\\    Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!\\\\    Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;\\\\    And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.\\\\    Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;\\\\    Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,\\\\    Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.\\\\    Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.\\\\    Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains\\\\    Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,\\\\    The cicatrice and capable impressure\\\\    Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,\\\\    Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;\\\\    Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes\\\\    That can do hurt.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. O dear Phebe,\\\\    If ever- as that ever may be near-\\\\    You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,\\\\    Then shall you know the wounds invisible\\\\    That love's keen arrows make.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. But till that time\\\\    Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,\\\\    Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;\\\\    As till that time I shall not pity thee.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your\\\\      mother,\\\\    That you insult, exult, and all at once,\\\\    Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-\\\\    As, by my faith, I see no more in you\\\\    Than without candle may go dark to bed-\\\\    Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?\\\\    Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?\\\\    I see no more in you than in the ordinary\\\\    Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,\\\\    I think she means to tangle my eyes too!\\\\    No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;\\\\    'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\\\\    Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\\\\    That can entame my spirits to your worship.\\\\    You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\\\\    Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?\\\\    You are a thousand times a properer man\\\\    Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you\\\\    That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.\\\\    'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;\\\\    And out of you she sees herself more proper\\\\    Than any of her lineaments can show her.\\\\    But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,\\\\    And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;\\\\    For I must tell you friendly in your ear:\\\\    Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.\\\\    Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;\\\\    Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.\\\\    So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;\\\\    I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall\\\\    in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee\\\\    with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look\\\\    you so upon me?\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,\\\\    For I am falser than vows made in wine;\\\\    Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,\\\\    'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.\\\\    Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.\\\\    Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,\\\\    And be not proud; though all the world could see,\\\\    None could be so abus'd in sight as he.\\\\    Come, to our flock.        Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:\\\\    'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.\\\\    If you do sorrow at my grief in love,\\\\    By giving love, your sorrow and my grief\\\\    Were both extermin'd.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. I would have you.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.\\\\    Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;\\\\    And yet it is not that I bear thee love;\\\\    But since that thou canst talk of love so well,\\\\    Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,\\\\    I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.\\\\    But do not look for further recompense\\\\    Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,\\\\    And I in such a poverty of grace,\\\\    That I shall think it a most plenteous crop\\\\    To glean the broken ears after the man\\\\    That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then\\\\    A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;\\\\    And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds\\\\    That the old carlot once was master of.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;\\\\    'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.\\\\    But what care I for words? Yet words do well\\\\    When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.\\\\    It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;\\\\    But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.\\\\    He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him\\\\    Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue\\\\    Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.\\\\    He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;\\\\    His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.\\\\    There was a pretty redness in his lip,\\\\    A little riper and more lusty red\\\\    Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference\\\\    Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.\\\\    There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him\\\\    In parcels as I did, would have gone near\\\\    To fall in love with him; but, for my part,\\\\    I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet\\\\    I have more cause to hate him than to love him;\\\\    For what had he to do to chide at me?\\\\    He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,\\\\    And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.\\\\    I marvel why I answer'd not again;\\\\    But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.\\\\    I'll write to him a very taunting letter,\\\\    And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. I'll write it straight;\\\\    The matter's in my head and in my heart;\\\\    I will be bitter with him and passing short.\\\\    Go with me, Silvius.

I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with\\\\    thee.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable\\\\    fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than\\\\    drunkards.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is\\\\    emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the\\\\    courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is\\\\    ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,\\\\    which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a\\\\    melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted\\\\    from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my\\\\    travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous\\\\    sadness.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be\\\\    sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then\\\\    to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and\\\\    poor hands.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.\\\\\\\\                        Enter ORLANDO\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a\\\\    fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to\\\\    travel for it too.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear\\\\    strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be\\\\    out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making\\\\    you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have\\\\    swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where\\\\    have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such\\\\    another trick, never come in my sight more.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a\\\\    minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the\\\\    thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said\\\\    of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll\\\\    warrant him heart-whole.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had\\\\    as lief be woo'd of a snail.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Of a snail!\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries\\\\    his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make\\\\    a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. What's that?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to\\\\    your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents\\\\    the slander of his wife.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a\\\\    better leer than you.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,\\\\    and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I\\\\    were your very very Rosalind?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were\\\\    gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.\\\\    Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for\\\\    lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to\\\\    kiss.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new\\\\    matter.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I\\\\    should think my honesty ranker than my wit.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. What, of my suit?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.\\\\    Am not I your Rosalind?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking\\\\    of her.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six\\\\    thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man\\\\    died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had\\\\    his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he\\\\    could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.\\\\    Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had\\\\    turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,\\\\    good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,\\\\    being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish\\\\    chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these\\\\    are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have\\\\    eaten them, but not for love.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for,\\\\    I protest, her frown might kill me.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I\\\\    will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me\\\\    what you will, I will grant it.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. What sayest thou?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Are you not good?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I hope so.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?\\\\    Come, sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,\\\\    Orlando. What do you say, sister?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I cannot say the words.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I will.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Ay, but when?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,\\\\    Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;\\\\    and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have\\\\    possess'd her.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. For ever and a day.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are\\\\    April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when\\\\    they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will\\\\    be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,\\\\    more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than\\\\    an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for\\\\    nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you\\\\    are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when\\\\    thou are inclin'd to sleep.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,\\\\    the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out\\\\    at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop\\\\    that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,\\\\    whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your\\\\    wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never\\\\    take her without her answer, unless you take her without her\\\\    tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's\\\\    occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will\\\\    breed it like a fool!\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be\\\\    with thee again.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would\\\\    prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less.\\\\    That flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and\\\\    so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and\\\\    by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot\\\\    of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will\\\\    think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow\\\\    lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may\\\\    be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore\\\\    beware my censure, and keep your promise.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my\\\\    Rosalind; so, adieu.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such\\\\    offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO\\\\\\\\  CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must\\\\    have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the\\\\    world what the bird hath done to her own nest.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst\\\\    know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;\\\\    my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection\\\\    in, it runs out.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of\\\\    thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind\\\\    rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are\\\\    out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,\\\\    Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a\\\\    shadow, and sigh till he come.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE II.\\\\\\\\The forest\\\\\\\\        Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters\\\\\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?\\\\\\\\  LORD. Sir, it was I.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and\\\\    it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a\\\\    branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?\\\\\\\\  LORD. Yes, sir.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise\\\\    enough.\\\\\\\\                    SONG.\\\\\\\\      What shall he have that kill'd the deer?\\\\      His leather skin and horns to wear.\\\\                              [The rest shall hear this burden:]\\\\           Then sing him home.\\\\\\\\      Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;\\\\      It was a crest ere thou wast born.\\\\           Thy father's father wore it;\\\\           And thy father bore it.\\\\      The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,\\\\      Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.                   Exeunt\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE III.\\\\\\\\The forest\\\\\\\\Enter ROSALIND and CELIA\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?\\\\    And here much Orlando!\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath\\\\    ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who\\\\    comes here.\\\\\\\\                      Enter SILVIUS\\\\\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;\\\\    My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.\\\\    I know not the contents; but, as I guess\\\\    By the stern brow and waspish action\\\\    Which she did use as she was writing of it,\\\\    It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,\\\\    I am but as a guiltless messenger.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,\\\\    And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.\\\\    She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;\\\\    She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,\\\\    Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!\\\\    Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;\\\\    Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,\\\\    This is a letter of your own device.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;\\\\    Phebe did write it.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,\\\\    And turn'd into the extremity of love.\\\\    I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,\\\\    A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think\\\\    That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;\\\\    She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.\\\\    I say she never did invent this letter:\\\\    This is a man's invention, and his hand.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;\\\\    A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,\\\\    Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain\\\\    Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,\\\\    Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect\\\\    Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;\\\\    Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.\\\\                                                         [Reads]\\\\\\\\            'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,\\\\            That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'\\\\\\\\    Can a woman rail thus?\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Call you this railing?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,\\\\             Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'\\\\\\\\    Did you ever hear such railing?\\\\\\\\            'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,\\\\            That could do no vengeance to me.'\\\\\\\\    Meaning me a beast.\\\\\\\\            'If the scorn of your bright eyne\\\\            Have power to raise such love in mine,\\\\            Alack, in me what strange effect\\\\            Would they work in mild aspect!\\\\            Whiles you chid me, I did love;\\\\            How then might your prayers move!\\\\            He that brings this love to the\\\\            Little knows this love in me;\\\\            And by him seal up thy mind,\\\\            Whether that thy youth and kind\\\\            Will the faithful offer take\\\\            Of me and all that I can make;\\\\            Or else by him my love deny,\\\\            And then I'll study how to die.'\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd!\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love\\\\    such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false\\\\    strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,\\\\    for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-\\\\    that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,\\\\    I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a\\\\    true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.\\\\                                                    Exit SILVIUS\\\\\\\\                         Enter OLIVER\\\\\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,\\\\    Where in the purlieus of this forest stands\\\\    A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.\\\\    The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream\\\\    Left on your right hand brings you to the place.\\\\    But at this hour the house doth keep itself;\\\\    There's none within.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,\\\\    Then should I know you by description-\\\\    Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,\\\\    Of female favour, and bestows himself\\\\    Like a ripe sister; the woman low,\\\\    And browner than her brother.' Are not you\\\\    The owner of the house I did inquire for?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;\\\\    And to that youth he calls his Rosalind\\\\    He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me\\\\    What man I am, and how, and why, and where,\\\\    This handkercher was stain'd.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. I pray you, tell it.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,\\\\    He left a promise to return again\\\\    Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,\\\\    Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,\\\\    Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,\\\\    And mark what object did present itself.\\\\    Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,\\\\    And high top bald with dry antiquity,\\\\    A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,\\\\    Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck\\\\    A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,\\\\    Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd\\\\    The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,\\\\    Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,\\\\    And with indented glides did slip away\\\\    Into a bush; under which bush's shade\\\\    A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,\\\\    Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,\\\\    When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis\\\\    The royal disposition of that beast\\\\    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.\\\\    This seen, Orlando did approach the man,\\\\    And found it was his brother, his elder brother.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;\\\\    And he did render him the most unnatural\\\\    That liv'd amongst men.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. And well he might so do,\\\\    For well I know he was unnatural.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,\\\\    Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;\\\\    But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,\\\\    And nature, stronger than his just occasion,\\\\    Made him give battle to the lioness,\\\\    Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling\\\\    From miserable slumber I awak'd.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Are you his brother?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame\\\\    To tell you what I was, since my conversion\\\\    So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. By and by.\\\\    When from the first to last, betwixt us two,\\\\    Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,\\\\    As how I came into that desert place-\\\\    In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,\\\\    Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,\\\\    Committing me unto my brother's love;\\\\    Who led me instantly unto his cave,\\\\    There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm\\\\    The lioness had torn some flesh away,\\\\    Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,\\\\    And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.\\\\    Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,\\\\    And, after some small space, being strong at heart,\\\\    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,\\\\    To tell this story, that you might excuse\\\\    His broken promise, and to give this napkin,\\\\    Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth\\\\    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.\\\\                                               [ROSALIND swoons]\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Look, he recovers.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I would I were at home.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. We'll lead you thither.\\\\    I pray you, will you take him by the arm?\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!\\\\    You lack a man's heart.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think\\\\    this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how\\\\    well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in\\\\    your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by\\\\    right.\\\\\\\\  CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.\\\\    Good sir, go with us.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back\\\\    How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my\\\\    counterfeiting to him. Will you go?

Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old\\\\    gentleman's saying.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.\\\\    But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to\\\\    you.\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the\\\\    world; here comes the man you mean.\\\\\\\\                         Enter WILLIAM\\\\\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,\\\\    we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be\\\\    flouting; we cannot hold.\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. Good ev'n, Audrey.\\\\\\\\  AUDREY. God ye good ev'n, William.\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. And good ev'n to you, sir.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy\\\\    head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. William, sir.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.\\\\    Art rich?\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and\\\\    yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying:\\\\'The\\\\    fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be\\\\    a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a\\\\    grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning\\\\    thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do\\\\    love this maid?\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. I do, sir.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. No, sir.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a\\\\    figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a\\\\    glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your\\\\    writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I\\\\    am he.\\\\\\\\  WILLIAM. Which he, sir?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you\\\\    clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society-which\\\\    in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is\\\\    woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,\\\\    clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;\\\\    or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into\\\\    death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,\\\\    or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;\\\\    will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and\\\\    fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.\\\\\\\\  AUDREY.

Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should\\\\    like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo?\\\\    and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy\\\\    her?\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty\\\\    of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden\\\\    consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she\\\\    loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It\\\\    shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue\\\\    that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live\\\\    and die a shepherd.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.\\\\    Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers.\\\\    Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.\\\\\\\\                        Enter ROSALIND\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. God save you, brother.\\\\\\\\  OLIVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear\\\\    thy heart in a scarf!\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. It is my arm.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a\\\\    lion.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon\\\\    when he show'd me your handkercher?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never\\\\    any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's\\\\    thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother\\\\    and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but\\\\    they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but\\\\    they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but\\\\    they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair\\\\    of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else\\\\    be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of\\\\\\\\\\\\    love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke\\\\    to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into\\\\    happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I\\\\    to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I\\\\    shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for\\\\    Rosalind?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking.\\\\    Know of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are\\\\    a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should\\\\    bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you\\\\    are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some\\\\    little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and\\\\    not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do\\\\    strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd\\\\    with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.\\\\    If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries\\\\    it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her.\\\\    I know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not\\\\    impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set\\\\    her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any\\\\    danger.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I\\\\    am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your\\\\    friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to\\\\    Rosalind, if you will.\\\\\\\\                     Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE\\\\\\\\    Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness\\\\    To show the letter that I writ to you.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study\\\\    To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.\\\\    You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;\\\\    Look upon him, love him; he worships you.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;\\\\    And so am I for Phebe.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO.

And I for Ganymede.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. And I for no woman.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,\\\\    All made of passion, and all made of wishes;\\\\    All adoration, duty, and observance,\\\\    All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,\\\\    All purity, all trial, all obedience;\\\\    And so am I for Phebe.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish\\\\    wolves against the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can.\\\\    [To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all\\\\    together. [ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry woman,\\\\    and I'll be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if\\\\    ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To\\\\    Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you, and\\\\    you shall be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] As you love\\\\    Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I\\\\    love no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you\\\\    commands.\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. Nor I.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. Nor I.                                         Exeunt\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE III.\\\\\\\\The forest\\\\\\\\Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY\\\\\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE.

Exeunt\\\\\\\\\\\\SCENE IV.\\\\\\\\The forest\\\\\\\\Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA\\\\\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy\\\\    Can do all this that he hath promised?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:\\\\    As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.\\\\\\\\               Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE\\\\\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:\\\\    You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,\\\\    You will bestow her on Orlando here?\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,\\\\    You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. So is the bargain.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?\\\\\\\\  SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.\\\\    Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;\\\\    You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;\\\\    Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,\\\\    Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;\\\\    Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her\\\\    If she refuse me; and from hence I go,\\\\    To make these doubts all even.\\\\                                       Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy\\\\    Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.\\\\\\\\  ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him\\\\    Methought he was a brother to your daughter.\\\\    But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,\\\\    And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments\\\\    Of many desperate studies by his uncle,\\\\    Whom he reports to be a great magician,\\\\    Obscured in the circle of this forest.\\\\\\\\                    Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY\\\\\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are\\\\    coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which\\\\    in all tongues are call'd fools.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded\\\\    gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a\\\\    courtier, he swears.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.\\\\    I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been\\\\    politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone\\\\    three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought\\\\    one.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the\\\\    seventh cause.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in\\\\    here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear\\\\    and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A\\\\    poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a\\\\    poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will.\\\\    Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl\\\\    in your foul oyster.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet\\\\    diseases.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on\\\\    the seventh cause?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more\\\\    seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain\\\\    courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not\\\\    cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort\\\\    Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would\\\\    send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip\\\\    Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.\\\\    This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,\\\\    he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof\\\\    Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie.\\\\    This is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie\\\\    Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor\\\\    he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords\\\\    and parted.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?\\\\\\\\  TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have\\\\    books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,\\\\    the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the\\\\    Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the\\\\    Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;\\\\    the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie\\\\    Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven\\\\    justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were\\\\    met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you\\\\    said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore\\\\    brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?\\\\    He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the\\\\    presentation of that he shoots his wit:\\\\\\\\          Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC\\\\\\\\    HYMEN.    Then is there mirth in heaven,\\\\              When earthly things made even\\\\                Atone together.\\\\              Good Duke, receive thy daughter;\\\\              Hymen from heaven brought her,\\\\                Yea, brought her hither,\\\\              That thou mightst join her hand with his,\\\\              Whose heart within his bosom is.\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND.

If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.\\\\\\\\  PHEBE. If sight and shape be true,\\\\    Why then, my love adieu!\\\\\\\\  ROSALIND.

Let me have audience for a word or two.\\\\    I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,\\\\    That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.\\\\    Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day\\\\    Men of great worth resorted to this forest,\\\\    Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,\\\\    In his own conduct, purposely to take\\\\    His brother here, and put him to the sword;\\\\    And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,\\\\    Where, meeting with an old religious man,\\\\    After some question with him, was converted\\\\    Both from his enterprise and from the world;\\\\    His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,\\\\    And all their lands restor'd to them again\\\\    That were with him exil'd. This to be true\\\\    I do engage my life.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man.\\\\    Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:\\\\    To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,\\\\    A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.\\\\    First, in this forest let us do those ends\\\\    That here were well begun and well begot;\\\\    And after, every of this happy number,\\\\    That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,\\\\    Shall share the good of our returned fortune,\\\\    According to the measure of their states.\\\\    Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,\\\\    And fall into our rustic revelry.\\\\    Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,\\\\    With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,\\\\    The Duke hath put on a religious life,\\\\    And thrown into neglect the pompous court.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites\\\\    There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.\\\\    [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;\\\\    Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.\\\\    [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;\\\\    [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies\\\\    [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;\\\\    [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage\\\\    Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;\\\\    I am for other than for dancing measures.\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.\\\\\\\\  JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have\\\\    I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit\\\\\\\\  DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed.

It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but\\\\    it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue.\\\\    If it be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play\\\\    needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and\\\\    good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues.\\\\    What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot\\\\    insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not\\\\    furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me.\\\\    My way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge\\\\    you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of\\\\    this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love\\\\    you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you\\\\    hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.\\\\    If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that\\\\    pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied\\\\    not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,\\\\    or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,\\\\    bid me farewell.\\\\\\\\THE END}\"}]"

young son, it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. care keeps his watch in every old mans eye, and where care lodges sleep will never lie; but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign. therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprousd with some distemprature; or if not so, then here i hit it right- our  hath not been in bed to-night.  rom. that last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.  friar. god pardon sin! wast thou with rosaline?  rom. with rosaline, my ghostly father? no. i have forgot that name, and that names woe.  friar. thats my good son! but where hast thou been then?  rom. ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again. i have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me thats by me wounded. both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies. i bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, my intercession likewise steads my foe.  friar. be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.  rom. then plainly know my hearts dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet; as mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, and all combind, save what thou must combine by holy marriage. when, and where, and how we met, we wood, and made exchange of vow, ill tell thee as we pass; but this i pray, that thou consent to marry us to-day.  friar. holy saint francis! what a change is here! is rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, so soon forsaken? young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. jesu maria! what a deal of brine hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline! how much salt water thrown away in waste, to season love, that of it doth not taste! the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears. lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not washd off yet. if eer thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, thou and these woes were all for rosaline. and art thou changd? pronounce this sentence then: women may fall when theres no strength in men.  rom. thou chidst me oft for loving rosaline.  friar. for doting, not for loving, pupil mine.  rom. and badst me bury love.  friar. not in a grave to lay one in, another out to have.  rom. i pray thee chide not. she whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow. the other did not so.  friar. o, she knew well thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. but come, young waverer, come go with me. in one respect ill thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove to turn your households rancour to pure love.  rom. o, let us hence! i stand on sudden haste.  friar. wisely, and slow. they stumble that run fast.exeunt.scene iv.a street.enter benvolio and mer. where the devil should this  be? came he not home to-night?  ben. not to his fathers. i spoke with his man.  mer. why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad.  ben.the kinsman to old capulet, hath sent a letter to his fathers house.  mer. a challenge, on my life.  ben.  will answer it.  mer. any man that can write may answer a letter.  ben. nay, he will answer the letters master, how he dares, being dared.  mer. alas, poorhe is already dead! stabbd with a white wenchs black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boys butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter ?  ben. why, what is ?  mer. more than prince of cats, i can tell you. o, hes the courageous captain of compliments. he fights as you sing pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.  ben. the what?  mer. the pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- these new tuners of accent! by jesu, a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good whore! why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mis, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? o, their bones, their bones! enter ben. here comes ! here comes !  mer. without his roe, like a dried herring. o flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in. laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love to berhyme her), dido a dowdy, cleopatra a gypsy, helen and hero hildings and harlots, this be a gray eye or so, but not to the purpose. signiorbon jour! theres a french salutation to your french slop. you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.  rom. good morrow to you both. what counterfeit did i give you?  mer. the slip, sir, the slip. can you not conceive?  rom. pardon, goodmy business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.  mer. thats as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.  rom. meaning, to cursy.  mer. thou hast most kindly hit it.  rom. a most courteous exposition.  mer. nay, i am the very pink of courtesy.  rom. pink for flower.  mer. right.  rom. why, then is my pump well-flowerd.  mer. well said! follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, solely singular.  rom. o single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!  mer. come between us, good benvolio! my wits faint.  rom. swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or ill cry a match.  mer. nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, i am done; for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, i am sure, i have in my whole five. was i with you there for the goose?  rom. thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.  mer. i will bite thee by the ear for that jest.  rom. nay, good goose, bite not!  mer. thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.  rom. and is it not, then, well servd in to a sweet goose?  mer. o, heres a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!  rom. i stretch it out for that word broad, which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.  mer. why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou ; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature. for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.  ben. stop there, stop there!  mer. thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.  ben. thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.  mer. o, thou art deceivd! i would have made it short; for i was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.  rom. heres goodly gear! enter nurse and her man [].  mer. a sail, a sail!  ben. two, two! a shirt and a smock.  nurse. ! anon.  nurse. my fan, mer. goodto hide her face; for her fans the fairer face of the two.  nurse. god ye good morrow, gentlemen.  mer. god ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.  nurse. is it good-den?

[to france] for you, great king,  i would not from your love make such a stray  to match you where i hate; therefore beseech you  t avert your liking a more worthier way  than on a wretch whom nature is ashamd  almost t acknowledge hers.  france. this is most strange,  that she that even but now was your best object,  the argument of your praise, balm of your age,  most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time  commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle  so many folds of favour. sure her offence  must be of such unnatural degree  that monsters it, or your fore-vouchd affection  falln into taint; which to believe of her  must be a faith that reason without miracle  should never plant in me.  cor. i yet beseech your majesty,  if for i want that glib and oily art  to speak and purpose not, since what i well intend,  ill dot before i speak- that you make known  it is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,  no unchaste action or dishonoured step,  that hath deprivd me of your grace and favour;  but even for want of that for which i am richer-  a still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue  as i am glad i have not, though not to have it  hath lost me in your liking.  lear. better thou  hadst not been born than not t have pleasd me better.  france. is it but this- a tardiness in nature  which often leaves the history unspoke  that it intends to do? my lord of burgundy,  what say you to the lady? loves not love  when it is mingled with regards that stands  aloof from th entire point. will you have her?  she is herself a dowry.  bur. royal lear,  give but that portion which yourself proposd,  and here i take cordelia by the hand,  duchess of burgundy.  lear. nothing! i have sworn; i am firm.  bur. i am sorry then you have so lost a father  that you must lose a husband.  cor. peace be with burgundy!  since that respects of fortune are his love,  i shall not be his wife.  france. fairest cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;  most choice, forsaken; and most lovd, despisd!  thee and thy virtues here i seize upon.  be it lawful i take up whats cast away.  gods, gods! tis strange that from their coldst neglect  my love should kindle to inflamd respect.  thy dowrless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,  is queen of us, of ours, and our fair france.  not all the dukes in watrish burgundy  can buy this unprizd precious maid of me.  bid them farewell, cordelia, though unkind.  thou losest here, a better where to find.  lear. thou hast her, france; let her be thine; for we  have no such daughter, nor shall ever see  that face of hers again. therefore be gone  without our grace, our love, our benison.  come, noble burgundy. flourish. exeunt lear, burgundy, [cornwall, albany,gloucester, and attendants].  france. bid farewell to your sisters.  cor. the jewels of our father, with washd eyes  cordelia leaves you. i know you what you are;  and, like a sister, am most loath to call  your faults as they are namd. use well our father.  to your professed bosoms i commit him;  but yet, alas, stood i within his grace,  i would prefer him to a better place!  so farewell to you both.  gon. prescribe not us our duties.  reg. let your study  be to content your lord, who hath receivd you  at fortunes alms. you have obedience scanted,  and well are worth the want that you have wanted.  cor. time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.  who cover faults, at last shame them derides.  well may you prosper!  france. come, my fair cordelia. exeunt france and cordelia.  gon. sister, it is not little i have to say of what most nearly  appertains to us both. i think our father will henceto-night.  reg. thats most certain, and with you; next month with us.  gon. you see how full of changes his age is. the observation we  have made of it hath not been little. he always lovd our  sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now casther  off appears too grossly.  reg. tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever butslenderly  known himself.  gon. the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then  must we look to receive from his age, not alone the  imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal  the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bringwith  them.  reg. such unconstant starts are we like to have from him asthis  of kents banishment.  gon. there is further compliment of leave-taking between franceand  him. pray you lets hit together. if our father carryauthority  with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender ofhis  will but offend us.  reg. we shall further think ont.  gon. we must do something, and i th heat.exeunt.scene ii.the earl of gloucesters castle.enter [edmund the] bastard solus, [with a letter].  edm. thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law  my services are bound. wherefore should i  stand in the plague of custom, and permit  the curiosity of nations to deprive me,  for that i am some twelve or fourteen moonshines  lag of a brother? why bastard? wherefore base?  when my dimensions are as well compact,  my mind as generous, and my shape as true,  as honest madams issue? why brand they us  with base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?  who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take  more composition and fierce quality  than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,  go to th creating a whole tribe of fops  got tween asleep and wake? well then,  legitimate edgar, i must have your land.  our fathers love is to the bastard edmund  as to th legitimate. fine word- legitimate!  well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,  and my invention thrive, edmund the base  shall top th legitimate. i grow; i prosper.  now, gods, stand up for bastards!  enter gloucester.  glou. kent banishd thus?

[puts up the letter.]  glou. why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?  edm. i know no news, my lord.  glou. what paper were you reading?  edm. nothing, my lord.  glou. no? what needed then that terrible dispatch of it intoyour  pocket? the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide  itself. lets see. come, if it be nothing, i shall not need  spectacles.  edm. i beseech you, sir, pardon me. it is a letter from mybrother  that i have not all oer-read; and for so much as i have  perusd, i find it not fit for your oerlooking.  glou. give me the letter, sir.  edm. i shall offend, either to detain or give it. the contents,as  in part i understand them, are to blame.  glou. lets see, lets see!  edm. i hope, for my brothers justification, he wrote this butas  an essay or taste of my virtue.  glou. (reads) this policy and reverence of age makes the world  bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us  till our oldness cannot relish them. i begin to find an idle  and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, whosways,  not as it hath power, but as it is sufferd. come to me,that  of this i may speak more. if our father would sleep till i  wakd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, andlive  the beloved of your brother,  edgar.  hum! conspiracy?

 edm. if the matter were good, my lord, i durst swear it werehis;  but in respect of that, i would fain think it were not.  glou. it is his.  edm. it is his hand, my lord; but i hope his heart is not inthe  contents.  glou. hath he never before sounded you in this business?  edm. never, my lord. but i have heard him oft maintain it to befit  that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father  should be as ward to the son, and the son manage hisrevenue.  glou. o villain, villain! his very opinion in the letter!abhorred  villain! unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than  brutish! go, sirrah, seek him. ill apprehend him.abominable  villain! where is he?  edm. i do not well know, my lord. if it shall please you tosuspend  your indignation against my brother till you can derive fromhim  better testimony of his intent, you should run a certaincourse;  where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his  purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour andshake  in pieces the heart of his obedience. i dare pawn down mylife  for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your  honour, and to no other pretence of danger.  glou. think you so?  edm. if your honour judge it meet, i will place you where youshall  hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance haveyour  satisfaction, and that without any further delay than thisvery  evening.  glou. he cannot be such a monster.  edm. nor is not, sure.  glou. to his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.  heaven and earth! edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, ipray  you; frame the business after your own wisdom. i wouldunstate  myself to be in a due resolution.  edm. i will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as i  shall find means, and acquaint you withal.  glou. these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no goodto  us. though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus,yet  nature finds itself scourgd by the sequent effects. lovecools,  friendship falls off, brothers divide. in cities, mutinies;in  countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bondcrackd  twixt son and father. this villain of mine comes under the  prediction; theres son against father: the king falls frombias  of nature; theres father against child. we have seen thebest  of our time. machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all  ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. findout  this villain, edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it  carefully. and the noble and true-hearted kent banishd! his  offence, honesty! tis strange.  exit.  edm. this is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when weare  sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, wemake  guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; asif  we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;  knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;  drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforcd obedience of  planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by adivine  thrusting on. an admirable evasion of whore-master man, tolay  his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! my father  compounded with my mother under the dragons tail, and my  nativity was under ursa major, so that it follows i am roughand  lecherous. fut! i should have been that i am, had the  maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on mybastardizing.  edgar-  enter edgar.  and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy.my  cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like tom obedlam.  o, these eclipses do portend these divisions! fa, sol, la,mi.  edg. how now, brother edmund?

 por. god made him, and therefore let him passe for aman, in truth i know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,why he hath a horse better then the neopolitans, a betterbad habite of frowning then the count palentine, heis euery man in no man, if a trassell sing, he fals straighta capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. if i shouldmarry him, i should marry twentie husbands: if heewould despise me, i would forgiue him, for if he loue meto madnesse, i should neuer requite himner. what say you then to fauconbridge, the yongbaron of england?  por. you know i say nothing to him, for hee vnderstandsnot me, nor i him: he hath neither latine, french,nor italian, and you will come into the court & swearethat i haue a poore pennie-worth in the english: hee is aproper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with adumbe show? how odly he is suited, i thinke he boughthis doublet in italie, his round hose in france, his bonnetin germanie, and his behauiour euery wherener. what thinke you of the other lord his neighbour?  por. that he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, forhe borrowed a boxe of the eare of the englishman, andswore he would pay him againe when hee was able: ithinke the frenchman became his suretie, and seald vnderfor anotherner. how like you the yong germaine, the duke ofsaxonies nephew?  por. very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:when he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and whenhe is worst, he is little better then a beast: and the worstfall that euer fell, i hope i shall make shift to go withouthimner. if he should offer to choose, and choose the rightcasket, you should refuse to performe your fathers will,if you should refuse to accept himpor. therefore for feare of the worst, i pray thee seta deepe glasse of reinish-wine on the contrary casket,for if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,i know he will choose it. i will doe any thing nerrissaere i will be married to a spungener. you neede not feare lady the hauing any ofthese lords, they haue acquainted me with their determinations,which is indeede to returne to their home,and to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you maybe won by some other sort then your fathers imposition,depending on the casketspor. if i liue to be as olde as sibilla, i will dye aschaste as diana: vnlesse i be obtained by the mannerof my fathers will: i am glad this parcell of wooersare so reasonable, for there is not one among them buti doate on his verie absence: and i wish them a faire departurener. doe you not remember ladie in your fatherstime, a venecian, a scholler and a souldior thatcame hither in companie of the marquesse of mountferrat?

[adam retires]  oliver. now, sir! what make you here?  orlando. nothing; i am not taught to make any thing.  oliver. what mar you then, sir?  orlando. marry, sir, i am helping you to mar that which god made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.  oliver. marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.  orlando. shall i keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? what prodigal portion have i spent that i should come to such penury?  oliver. know you where you are, sir?  orlando. o, sir, very well; here in your orchard.  oliver. know you before whom, sir?  orlando. ay, better than him i am before knows me. i know you are my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you should so know me. the courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. i have as much of my father in me as you, albeit i confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.  oliver. what, boy! [strikes him]  orlando. come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.  oliver. wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?  orlando. i am no villain; i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys. he was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. wert thou not my brother, i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulld out thy tongue for saying so. thou has raild on thyself.  adam. [coming forward] sweet masters, be patient; for your fathers remembrance, be at accord.  oliver. let me go, i say.  orlando. i will not, till i please; you shall hear me. my father chargd you in his will to give me good education: you have traind me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. the spirit of my father grows strong in me, and i will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament; with that i will go buy my fortunes.  oliver. and what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent? well, sir, get you in. i will not long be troubled with you; you shall have some part of your will. i pray you leave me.  orlando. i no further offend you than becomes me for my good.  oliver. get you with him, you old dog.  adam. is old dog my reward? most true, i have lost my teeth in your service. god be with my old master! he would not have spoke such a word.  exeunt orlando and adam  oliver. is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? i will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. holla, dennis!  enter dennis  dennis. calls your worship?  oliver. not charles, the dukes wrestler, here to speak with me?  dennis. so please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.  oliver. call him in. [exit dennis] twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.  enter charles  charles. good morrow to your worship.  oliver. good monsieur charles! whats the new news at the new court?  charles. theres no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that is, the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.  oliver. can you tell if rosalind, the dukes daughter, be banished with her father?  charles. o, no; for the dukes daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. she is at the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.  oliver. where will the old duke live?  charles. they say he is already in the forest of arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old robin hood of england. they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.  oliver. what, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?  charles. marry, do i, sir; and i came to acquaint you with a matter. i am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother, orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguisd against me to try a fall. to-morrow, sir, i wrestle for my credit; and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, i would be loath to foil him, as i must, for my own honour, if he come in; therefore, out of my love to you, i came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is thing of his own search and altogether against my will.  oliver. charles, i thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite. i had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. ill tell thee, charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of france; full of ambition, an envious emulator of every mans good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother. therefore use thy discretion: i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. and thou wert best look tot; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other; for, i assure thee, and almost with tears i speak it, there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. i speak but brotherly of him; but should i anatomize him to thee as he is, i must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.  charles. i am heartily glad i came hither to you. if he come to-morrow ill give him his payment. if ever he go alone again, ill never wrestle for prize more. and so, god keep your worship! exit  oliver. farewell, good charles. now will i stir this gamester. i hope i shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet i know not why, hates nothing more than he. yet hes gentle; never schoold and yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that i am altogether misprised. but it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither, which now ill go about.  exit<<this electronic version of the complete works of williamshakespeare is copyright 1990-1993 by world library, inc., and isprovided by project gutenberg etext of carnegie mellon universitywith permission.  electronic and machine readable copies may bedistributed so long as such copies (1) are for your or otherspersonal use only, and (2) are not distributed or usedcommercially.  prohibited commercial distribution includes by anyservice that charges for download time or for membership.>>scene ii.a lawn before the dukes palaceenter rosalind and celia  celia. i pray thee, rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.  rosalind. dear celia, i show more mirth than i am mistress of; and would you yet i were merrier? unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.  celia. herein i see thou lovst me not with the full weight that i love thee. if my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temperd as mine is to thee.  rosalind. well, i will forget the condition of my estate, to rejoice in yours.  celia. you know my father hath no child but i, nor none is like to have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, i will render thee again in affection. by mine honour, i will; and when i break that oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet rose, my dear rose, be merry.  rosalind. from henceforth i will, coz, and devise sports. let me see; what think you of falling in love?  celia. marry, i prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.  rosalind. what shall be our sport, then?  celia. let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.  rosalind. i would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.  celia. tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.  rosalind. nay; now thou goest from fortunes office to natures: fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of nature. enter touchstone  celia. no; when nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by fortune fall into the fire? though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune, hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?  rosalind. indeed, there is fortune too hard for nature, when fortune makes natures natural the cutter-off of natures wit.  celia. peradventure this is not fortunes work neither, but natures, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. how now, wit! whither wander you?  touchstone. mistress, you must come away to your father.  celia. were you made the messenger?  touchstone. no, by mine honour; but i was bid to come for you.  rosalind. where learned you that oath, fool?  touchstone. of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught. now ill stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.  celia. how prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?  rosalind. ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.  touchstone. stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that i am a knave.  celia. by our beards, if we had them, thou art.  touchstone. by my knavery, if i had it, then i were. but if you swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard.  celia. prithee, who ist that thou meanst?  touchstone. one that old frederick, your father, loves.  celia. my fathers love is enough to honour him. enough, speak no more of him; youll be whipt for taxation one of these days.  touchstone. the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.  celia. by my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. here comes monsieur le beau.enter le beau  rosalind. with his mouth full of news.  celia. which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.  rosalind. then shall we be news-crammd.  celia. all the better; we shall be the more marketable. bon jour, monsieur le beau. whats the news?  le beau. fair princess, you have lost much good sport.  celia. sport! of what colour?  le beau. what colour, madam? how shall i answer you?  rosalind. as wit and fortune will.  touchstone. or as the destinies decrees.  celia. well said; that was laid on with a trowel.  touchstone. nay, if i keep not my rank-  rosalind. thou losest thy old smell.  le beau. you amaze me, ladies. i would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.  rosalind. yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.  le beau. i will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.  celia. well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.  le beau. there comes an old man and his three sons-  celia. i could match this beginning with an old tale.  le beau. three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.  rosalind. with bills on their necks: be it known unto all men by these presents-  le beau. the eldest of the three wrestled with charles, the dukes wrestler; which charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. so he servd the second, and so the third. yonder they lie; the poor old man, their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.  rosalind. alas!  touchstone. but what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?  le beau. why, this that i speak of.  touchstone. thus men may grow wiser every day. it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.  celia. or i, i promise thee.  rosalind. but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? shall we see this wrestling, cousin?  le beau. you must, if you stay here; for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.  celia. yonder, sure, they are coming. let us now stay and see it.  flourish. enter duke frederick, lords, orlando,charles, and attendants  frederick. come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.  rosalind. is yonder the man?  le beau. even he, madam.  celia. alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.  frederick. how now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither to see the wrestling?  rosalind. ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.  frederick. you will take little delight in it, i can tell you, there is such odds in the man. in pity of the challengers youth i would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.  celia. call him hither, good monsieur le beau.  frederick. do so; ill not be by. [duke frederick goes apart]  le beau. monsieur the challenger, the princess calls for you.  orlando. i attend them with all respect and duty.  rosalind. young man, have you challengd charles the wrestler?  orlando. no, fair princess; he is the general challenger. i come but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.  celia. young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. you have seen cruel proof of this mans strength; if you saw yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. we pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.  rosalind. do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward.  orlando. i beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing. but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial; wherein if i be foild there is but one shamd that was never gracious; if killd, but one dead that is willing to be so. i shall do my friends no wrong, for i have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it i have nothing; only in the world i fill up a place, which may be better supplied when i have made it empty.  rosalind. the little strength that i have, i would it were with you.  celia. and mine to eke out hers.  rosalind. fare you well. pray heaven i be deceivd in you!  celia. your hearts desires be with you!  charles. come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?  orlando. ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.  frederick. you shall try but one fall.  charles. no, i warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.  orlando. you mean to mock me after; you should not have mockd me before; but come your ways.  rosalind. now, hercules be thy speed, young man!  celia. i would i were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.[they wrestle]  rosalind. o excellent young man!  celia. if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye, i can tell who should down.  [charles is thrown. shout]  frederick. no more, no more.  orlando. yes, i beseech your grace; i am not yet well breathd.  frederick. how dost thou, charles?  le beau. he cannot speak, my lord.  frederick. bear him away. what is thy name, young man?  orlando. orlando, my liege; the youngest son of sir rowland de boys.  frederick. i would thou hadst been son to some man else. the world esteemd thy father honourable, but i did find him still mine enemy. thou shouldst have better pleasd me with this deed, hadst thou descended from another house. but fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth; i would thou hadst told me of another father.exeunt duke, train, and le beau  celia. were i my father, coz, would i do this?  orlando. i am more proud to be sir rowlands son, his youngest son- and would not change that calling to be adopted heir to frederick.  rosalind. my father lovd sir rowland as his soul, and all the world was of my fathers mind; had i before known this young man his son, i should have given him tears unto entreaties ere he should thus have venturd.  celia. gentle cousin, let us go thank him, and encourage him; my fathers rough and envious disposition sticks me at heart. sir, you have well deservd; if you do keep your promises in love but justly as you have exceeded all promise, your mistress shall be happy.  rosalind. gentleman,  [giving him a chain from her neck] wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune, that could give more, but that her hand lacks means. shall we go, coz?  celia. ay. fare you well, fair gentleman.  orlando. can i not say i thank you? my better parts are all thrown down; and that which here stands up is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.  rosalind. he calls us back. my pride fell with my fortunes; ill ask him what he would. did you call, sir? sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown more than your enemies.  celia. will you go, coz?  rosalind. have with you. fare you well.exeunt rosalind and celia  orlando. what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue? i cannot speak to her, yet she urgd conference. o poor orlando, thou art overthrown! or charles or something weaker masters thee. re-enter le beau  le beau. good sir, i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place. albeit you have deservd high commendation, true applause, and love, yet such is now the dukes condition that he misconstrues all that you have done. the duke is humorous; what he is, indeed, more suits you to conceive than i to speak of.  orlando. i thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this: which of the two was daughter of the duke that here was at the wrestling?  le beau. neither his daughter, if we judge by manners; but yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter; the other is daughter to the banishd duke, and here detaind by her usurping uncle, to keep his daughter company; whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters. but i can tell you that of late this duke hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece, grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good fathers sake; and, on my life, his malice gainst the lady will suddenly break forth. sir, fare you well. hereafter, in a better world than this, i shall desire more love and knowledge of you.  orlando. i rest much bounden to you; fare you well. exit le beau thus must i from the smoke into the smother; from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother. but heavenly rosalind! exitscene iii.the dukes palaceenter celia and rosalind  celia. why, cousin! why, rosalind! cupid have mercy! not a word?  rosalind. not one to throw at a dog.  celia. no, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.  rosalind. then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamd with reasons and the other mad without any.  celia. but is all this for your father?  rosalind. no, some of it is for my childs father. o, how full of briers is this working-day world!  celia. they are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them.  rosalind. i could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.  celia. hem them away.  rosalind. i would try, if i could cry hem and have him.  celia. come, come, wrestle with thy affections.  rosalind. o, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.  celia. o, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in despite of a fall. but, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest. is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowlands youngest son?  rosalind. the duke my father lovd his father dearly.  celia. doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? by this kind of chase i should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly; yet i hate not orlando.  rosalind. no, faith, hate him not, for my sake.  celia. why should i not? doth he not deserve well?  enter duke frederick, with lords  rosalind. let me love him for that; and do you love him because i do. look, here comes the duke.  celia. with his eyes full of anger.  frederick. mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, and get you from our court.  rosalind. me, uncle?  frederick. you, cousin. within these ten days if that thou beest found so near our public court as twenty miles, thou diest for it.  rosalind. i do beseech your grace, let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me. if with myself i hold intelligence, or have acquaintance with mine own desires; if that i do not dream, or be not frantic- as i do trust i am not- then, dear uncle, never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness.  frederick. thus do all traitors; if their purgation did consist in words, they are as innocent as grace itself. let it suffice thee that i trust thee not.  rosalind. yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor. tell me whereon the likelihood depends.  frederick. thou art thy fathers daughter; theres enough.  rosalind. so was i when your highness took his dukedom; so was i when your highness banishd him. treason is not inherited, my lord; or, if we did derive it from our friends, whats that to me? my father was no traitor. then, good my liege, mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous.  celia. dear sovereign, hear me speak.  frederick. ay, celia; we stayd her for your sake, else had she with her father rangd along.  celia. i did not then entreat to have her stay; it was your pleasure, and your own remorse; i was too young that time to value her, but now i know her. if she be a traitor, why so am i: we still have slept together, rose at an instant, learnd, playd, eat together; and wheresoeer we went, like junos swans, still we went coupled and inseparable.  frederick. she is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness, her very silence and her patience, speak to the people, and they pity her. thou art a fool. she robs thee of thy name; and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone. then open not thy lips. firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have passd upon her; she is banishd.  celia. pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege; i cannot live out of her company.  frederick. you are a fool. you, niece, provide yourself. if you outstay the time, upon mine honour, and in the greatness of my word, you die. exeunt duke and lords  celia. o my poor rosalind! whither wilt thou go? wilt thou change fathers? i will give thee mine. i charge thee be not thou more grievd than i am.  rosalind. i have more cause.  celia. thou hast not, cousin. prithee be cheerful. knowst thou not the duke hath banishd me, his daughter?  rosalind. that he hath not.  celia. no, hath not? rosalind lacks, then, the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one. shall we be sundred? shall we part, sweet girl? no; let my father seek another heir. therefore devise with me how we may fly, whither to go, and what to bear with us; and do not seek to take your charge upon you, to bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out; for, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, say what thou canst, ill go along with thee.  rosalind. why, whither shall we go?  celia. to seek my uncle in the forest of arden.  rosalind. alas, what danger will it be to us, maids as we are, to travel forth so far! beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.  celia. ill put myself in poor and mean attire, and with a kind of umber smirch my face; the like do you; so shall we pass along, and never stir assailants.  rosalind. were it not better, because that i am more than common tall, that i did suit me all points like a man? a gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh, a boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart lie there what hidden womans fear there will- well have a swashing and a martial outside, as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances.  celia. what shall i call thee when thou art a man?  rosalind. ill have no worse a name than joves own page, and therefore look you call me ganymede. but what will you be calld?  celia. something that hath a reference to my state: no longer celia, but aliena.  rosalind. but, cousin, what if we assayd to steal the clownish fool out of your fathers court? would he not be a comfort to our travel?  celia. hell go along oer the wide world with me; leave me alone to woo him. lets away, and get our jewels and our wealth together; devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight. now go we in content to liberty, and not to banishment.  exeunt<<this electronic version of the complete works of williamshakespeare is copyright 1990-1993 by world library, inc., and isprovided by project gutenberg etext of carnegie mellon universitywith permission.  electronic and machine readable copies may bedistributed so long as such copies (1) are for your or otherspersonal use only, and (2) are not distributed or usedcommercially.  prohibited commercial distribution includes by anyservice that charges for download time or for membership.>>'},\n",

are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court? here feel we not the penalty of adam, the seasons difference; as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winters wind, which when it bites and blows upon my body, even till i shrink with cold, i smile and say this is no flattery; these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am. sweet are the uses of adversity, which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head; and this our life, exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything. i would not change it.  amiens. happy is your grace, that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style.  duke senior. come, shall we go and kill us venison? and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, being native burghers of this desert city, should, in their own confines, with forked heads have their round haunches gord.  first lord. indeed, my lord, the melancholy jaques grieves at that; and, in that kind, swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banishd you. to-day my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood! to the which place a poor sequestred stag, that from the hunters aim had taen a hurt, did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord, the wretched animal heavd forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting; and the big round tears coursd one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, much marked of the melancholy jaques, stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook, augmenting it with tears.  duke senior. but what said jaques? did he not moralize this spectacle?  first lord. o, yes, into a thousand similes. first, for his weeping into the needless stream: poor deer, quoth he thou makst a testament as worldlings do, giving thy sum of more to that which had too much. then, being there alone, left and abandoned of his velvet friends: tis right; quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company. anon, a careless herd, full of the pasture, jumps along by him and never stays to greet him. ay, quoth jaques sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens; tis just the fashion. wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there? thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country, city, court, yea, and of this our life; swearing that we are mere usurpers, tyrants, and whats worse, to fright the animals, and to kill them up in their assignd and native dwelling-place.  duke senior. and did you leave him in this contemplation?  second lord. we did, my lord, weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer.  duke senior. show me the place; i love to cope him in these sullen fits, for then hes full of matter.  first lord. ill bring you to him straight. exeuntscene ii.the dukes palaceenter duke frederick, with lords  frederick. can it be possible that no man saw them? it cannot be; some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this.  first lord. i cannot hear of any that did see her. the ladies, her attendants of her chamber, saw her abed, and in the morning early they found the bed untreasurd of their mistress.  second lord. my lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing. hisperia, the princess gentlewoman, confesses that she secretly oerheard your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles; and she believes, wherever they are gone, that youth is surely in their company.  frederick. send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither. if he be absent, bring his brother to me; ill make him find him. do this suddenly; and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways. exeuntscene iii.before olivers houseenter orlando and adam, meeting  orlando. whos there?  adam. what, my young master? o my gentle master! o my sweet master! o you memory of old sir rowland! why, what make you here? why are you virtuous? why do people love you? and wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant? why would you be so fond to overcome the bonny prizer of the humorous duke? your praise is come too swiftly home before you. know you not, master, to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies? no more do yours. your virtues, gentle master, are sanctified and holy traitors to you. o, what a world is this, when what is comely envenoms him that bears it!  orlando. why, whats the matter?  adam. o unhappy youth! come not within these doors; within this roof the enemy of all your graces lives. your brother- no, no brother; yet the son- yet not the son; i will not call him son of him i was about to call his father- hath heard your praises; and this night he means to burn the lodging where you use to lie, and you within it. if he fail of that, he will have other means to cut you off; i overheard him and his practices. this is no place; this house is but a butchery; abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.  orlando. why, whither, adam, wouldst thou have me go?  adam. no matter whither, so you come not here.  orlando. what, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food, or with a base and boistrous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road? this i must do, or know not what to do; yet this i will not do, do how i can. i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother.  adam. but do not so. i have five hundred crowns, the thrifty hire i savd under your father, which i did store to be my foster-nurse, when service should in my old limbs lie lame, and unregarded age in corners thrown. take that, and he that doth the ravens feed, yea, providently caters for the sparrow, be comfort to my age! here is the gold; all this i give you. let me be your servant; though i look old, yet i am strong and lusty; for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood, nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility; therefore my age is as a lusty winter, frosty, but kindly. let me go with you; ill do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities.  orlando. o good old man, how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world, when service sweat for duty, not for meed! thou art not for the fashion of these times, where none will sweat but for promotion, and having that do choke their service up even with the having; it is not so with thee. but, poor old man, thou prunst a rotten tree that cannot so much as a blossom yield in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry. but come thy ways, well go along together, and ere we have thy youthful wages spent well light upon some settled low content.  adam. master, go on; and i will follow the to the last gasp, with truth and loyalty. from seventeen years till now almost four-score here lived i, but now live here no more. at seventeen years many their fortunes seek, but at fourscore it is too late a week; yet fortune cannot recompense me better than to die well and not my masters debtor. exeuntscene iv.the forest of ardenenter rosalind for ganymede, celia for aliena, and clown alias touchstone  rosalind. o jupiter, how weary are my spirits!  touchstone. i care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.  rosalind. i could find in my heart to disgrace my mans apparel, and to cry like a woman; but i must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat; therefore, courage, good aliena.  celia. i pray you bear with me; i cannot go no further.  touchstone. for my part, i had rather bear with you than bear you; yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you; for i think you have no money in your purse.  rosalind. well,. this is the forest of arden.  touchstone. ay, now am i in arden; the more fool i; when i was at home i was in a better place; but travellers must be content.enter corin and silvius  rosalind. ay, be so, good touchstone. look you, who comes here, a young man and an old in solemn talk.  corin. that is the way to make her scorn you still.  silvius. o corin, that thou knewst how i do love her!  corin. i partly guess; for i have lovd ere now.  silvius. no, corin, being old, thou canst not guess, though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sighd upon a midnight pillow. but if thy love were ever like to mine, as sure i think did never man love so, how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?  corin. into a thousand that i have forgotten.  silvius. o, thou didst then never love so heartily! if thou remembrest not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into, thou hast not lovd; or if thou hast not sat as i do now, wearing thy hearer in thy mistress praise, thou hast not lovd; or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly, as my passion now makes me, thou hast not lovd. o phebe, phebe, phebe!  exit silvius  rosalind. alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound, i have by hard adventure found mine own.  touchstone. and i mine. i remember, when i was in love, i broke my sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to jane smile; and i remember the kissing of her batler, and the cows dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milkd; and i remember the wooing of peascod instead of her; from whom i took two cods, and giving her them again, said with weeping tears wear these for my sake. we that are true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.  rosalind. thou speakst wiser than thou art ware of.  touchstone. nay, i shall neer be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it.  rosalind. jove, jove! this shepherds passion is much upon my fashion.  touchstone. and mine; but it grows something stale with me.  celia. i pray you, one of you question yond man if he for gold will give us any food; i faint almost to death.  touchstone. holla, you clown!  rosalind. peace, fool; hes not thy ensman.  corin. who calls?  touchstone. your betters, sir.  corin. else are they very wretched.  rosalind. peace, i say. good even to you, friend.  corin. and to you, gentle sir, and to you all.  rosalind. i prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment, bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed. heres a young maid with travel much oppressd, and faints for succour.  corin. fair sir, i pity her, and wish, for her sake more than for mine own, my fortunes were more able to relieve her; but i am shepherd to another man, and do not shear the fleeces that i graze. my master is of churlish disposition, and little recks to find the way to heaven by doing deeds of hospitality. besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed, are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now, by reason of his absence, there is nothing that you will feed on; but what is, come see, and in my voice most welcome shall you be.  rosalind. what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?  corin. that young swain that you saw here but erewhile, that little cares for buying any thing.  rosalind. i pray thee, if it stand with honesty, buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock, and thou shalt have to pay for it of us.  celia. and we will mend thy wages. i like this place, and willingly could waste my time in it.  corin. assuredly the thing is to be sold. go with me; if you like upon report the soil, the profit, and this kind of life, i will your very faithful feeder be, and buy it with your gold right suddenly. exeuntscene v.another part of the forestenter amiens, jaques, and others  song  amiens. under the greenwood treewho loves to lie with me,and turn his merry noteunto the sweet birds throat, come hither, come hither, come hither.here shall he seeno enemy but winter and rough weather.  jaques. more, more, i prithee, more.  amiens. it will make you melancholy, monsieur jaques.  jaques. i thank it. more, i prithee, more. i can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. more, i prithee, more.  amiens. my voice is ragged; i know i cannot please you.  jaques. i do not desire you to please me; i do desire you to sing. come, more; another stanzo. call you em stanzos?  amiens. what you will, monsieur jaques.  jaques. nay, i care not for their names; they owe me nothing. will you sing?  amiens. more at your request than to please myself.  jaques. well then, if ever i thank any man, ill thank you; but that they call compliment is like th encounter of two dog-apes; and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.  amiens. well, ill end the song. sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree. he hath been all this day to look you.  jaques. and i have been all this day to avoid him. he is to disputable for my company. i think of as many matters as he; but i give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. come, warble, come.  song  [all together here]  who doth ambition shun,  and loves to live i th sun,  seeking the food he eats,  and pleasd with what he gets,come hither, come hither, come hither.  here shall he see  no enemy  but winter and rough weather.  jaques. ill give you a verse to this note that i made yesterday in despite of my invention.  amiens. and ill sing it.  jaques. thus it goes: if it do come to pass that any man turn ass, leaving his wealth and ease a stubborn will to please,  ducdame, ducdame, ducdame; here shall he see gross fools as he, an if he will come to me.  amiens. whats that ducdame?  jaques. tis a greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. ill go sleep, if i can; if i cannot, ill rail against all the first-born of egypt.  amiens. and ill go seek the duke; his banquet is prepard.exeunt severallyscene vi.the forestenter orlando and adam  adam. dear master, i can go no further. o, i die for food! here lie i down, and measure out my grave. farewell, kind master.  orlando. why, how now, adam! no greater heart in thee? live a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. if this uncouth forest yield anything savage, i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee. thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. for my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the arms end. i will here be with the presently; and if i bring thee not something to eat, i will give thee leave to die; but if thou diest before i come, thou art a mocker of my labour. well said! thou lookst cheerly; and ill be with thee quickly. yet thou liest in the bleak air. come, i will bear thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live anything in this desert. cheerly, good adam! exeuntscene vii.the foresta table set out. enter duke senior, amiens, and lords, like outlaws  duke senior. i think he be transformd into a beast; for i can nowhere find him like a man.  first lord. my lord, he is but even now gone hence; here was he merry, hearing of a song.  duke senior. if he, compact of jars, grow musical, we shall have shortly discord in the spheres. go seek him; tell him i would speak with him. enter jaques  first lord. he saves my labour by his own approach.  duke senior. why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, that your poor friends must woo your company? what, you look merrily!  jaques. a fool, a fool! i met a fool i th forest, a motley fool. a miserable world! as i do live by food, i met a fool, who laid him down and baskd him in the sun, and raild on lady fortune in good terms, in good set terms- and yet a motley fool. good morrow, fool, quoth i; no, sir, quoth he, call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune. and then he drew a dial from his poke, and, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, says very wisely, it is ten oclock; thus we may see, quoth he, how the world wags; tis but an hour ago since it was nine; and after one hour more twill be eleven; and so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe, and then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot; and thereby hangs a tale. when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time, my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative; and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial. o noble fool! a worthy fool! motleys the only wear.  duke senior. what fool is this?  jaques. o worthy fool! one that hath been a courtier, and says, if ladies be but young and fair, they have the gift to know it; and in his brain, which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage, he hath strange places crammd with observation, the which he vents in mangled forms. o that i were a fool! i am ambitious for a motley coat.  duke senior. thou shalt have one.  jaques. it is my only suit, provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise. i must have liberty withal, as large a charter as the wind, to blow on whom i please, for so fools have; and they that are most galled with my folly, they most must laugh. and why, sir, must they so? the why is plain as way to parish church: he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly, although he smart, not to seem senseless of the bob; if not, the wise mans folly is anatomizd even by the squandring glances of the fool. invest me in my motley; give me leave to speak my mind, and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th infected world, if they will patiently receive my medicine.  duke senior. fie on thee! i can tell what thou wouldst do.  jaques. what, for a counter, would i do but good?  duke senior. most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin; for thou thyself hast been a libertine, as sensual as the brutish sting itself; and all th embossed sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.  jaques. why, who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party? doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, till that the wearers very means do ebb? what woman in the city do i name when that i say the city-woman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders? who can come in and say that i mean her, when such a one as she such is her neighbour? or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost, thinking that i mean him, but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech? there then! how then? what then? let me see wherein my tongue hath wrongd him: if it do him right, then he hath wrongd himself; if he be free, why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies, unclaimd of any man. but who comes here? enter orlando with his sword drawn  orlando. forbear, and eat no more.  jaques. why, i have eat none yet.  orlando. nor shalt not, till necessity be servd.  jaques. of what kind should this cock come of?  duke senior. art thou thus boldend, man, by thy distress? or else a rude despiser of good manners, that in civility thou seemst so empty?  orlando. you touchd my vein at first: the thorny point of bare distress hath taen from me the show of smooth civility; yet arn i inland bred, and know some nurture. but forbear, i say; he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered.  jaques. an you will not be answerd with reason, i must die.  duke senior. what would you have? your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness.  orlando. i almost die for food, and let me have it.  duke senior. sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.  orlando. speak you so gently? pardon me, i pray you; i thought that all things had been savage here, and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment. but whateer you are that in this desert inaccessible, under the shade of melancholy boughs, lose and neglect the creeping hours of time; if ever you have lookd on better days, if ever been where bells have knolld to church, if ever sat at any good mans feast, if ever from your eyelids wipd a tear, and know what tis to pity and be pitied, let gentleness my strong enforcement be; in the which hope i blush, and hide my sword.  duke senior. true is it that we have seen better days, and have with holy bell been knolld to church, and sat at good mens feasts, and wipd our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendred; and therefore sit you down in gentleness, and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be ministred.  orlando. then but forbear your food a little while, whiles, like a doe, i go to find my fawn, and give it food. there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limpd in pure love; till he be first sufficd, oppressd with two weak evils, age and hunger, i will not touch a bit.  duke senior. go find him out. and we will nothing waste till you return.  orlando. i thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort! exit  duke senior. thou seest we are not all alone unhappy: this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in.  jaques. all the worlds a stage, and all the men and women merely players; they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages. at first the infant, mewling and puking in the nurses arms; then the whining school-boy, with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like snail unwillingly to school. and then the lover, sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow. then a soldier, full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth. and then the justice, in fair round belly with good capon lind, with eyes severe and beard of formal cut, full of wise saws and modern instances; and so he plays his part. the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipperd pantaloon, with spectacles on nose and pouch on side, his youthful hose, well savd, a world too wide for his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, turning again toward childish treble, pipes and whistles in his sound. last scene of all, that ends this strange eventful history, is second childishness and mere oblivion; sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.re-enter orlando with adam  duke senior. welcome. set down your venerable burden. and let him feed.  orlando. i thank you most for him.  adam. so had you need; i scarce can speak to thank you for myself.  duke senior. welcome; fall to. i will not trouble you as yet to question you about your fortunes. give us some music; and, good cousin, sing. songblow, blow, thou winter wind,thou art not so unkind  as mans ingratitude;thy tooth is not so keen,because thou art not seen,  although thy breath be rude. heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly. most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.then, heigh-ho, the holly!  this life is most jolly.freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,that dost not bite so nigh  as benefits forgot;though thou the waters warp,thy sting is not so sharp  as friend remembred not. heigh-ho! sing, &c.  duke senior. if that you were the good sir rowlands son, as you have whisperd faithfully you were, and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limnd and living in your face, be truly welcome hither. i am the duke that lovd your father. the residue of your fortune, go to my cave and tell me. good old man, thou art right welcome as thy master is. support him by the arm. give me your hand, and let me all your fortunes understand.  exeunt'},\n",

 touchstone. truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherds life, it is nought. in respect that it is solitary, i like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. as it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?  corin. no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.  touchstone. such a one is a natural philosopher. wast ever in court, shepherd?  corin. no, truly.  touchstone. then thou art damnd.  corin. nay, i hope.  touchstone. truly, thou art damnd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.  corin. for not being at court? your reason.  touchstone. why, if thou never wast at court thou never sawst good manners; if thou never sawst good manners, then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.  corin. not a whit, touchstone. those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court. you told me you salute not at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.  touchstone. instance, briefly; come, instance.  corin. why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you know, are greasy.  touchstone. why, do not your courtiers hands sweat? and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? shallow, shallow. a better instance, i say; come.  corin. besides, our hands are hard.  touchstone. your lips will feel them the sooner. shallow again. a more sounder instance; come.  corin. and they are often tarrd over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? the courtiers hands are perfumd with civet.  touchstone. most shallow man! thou worms meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. mend the instance, shepherd.  corin. you have too courtly a wit for me; ill rest.  touchstone. wilt thou rest damnd? god help thee, shallow man! god make incision in thee! thou art raw.  corin. sir, i am a true labourer: i earn that i eat, get that i wear; owe no man hate, envy no mans happiness; glad of other mens good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.  touchstone. that is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. if thou beest not damnd for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds; i cannot see else how thou shouldst scape.  corin. here comes young master ganymede, my new mistresss brother.enter rosalind, reading a paper  rosalind.from the east to western inde,  no jewel is like rosalinde.  her worth, being mounted on the wind,  through all the world bears rosalinde.  all the pictures fairest lind  are but black to rosalinde.  let no face be kept in mind  but the fair of rosalinde.  touchstone. ill rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted. it is the right butter-womens rank to market.  rosalind. out, fool!  touchstone.for a taste: if a hart do lack a hind, let him seek out rosalinde. if the cat will after kind, so be sure will rosalinde. winter garments must be lind, so must slender rosalinde. they that reap must sheaf and bind, then to cart with rosalinde. sweetest nut hath sourest rind, such a nut is rosalinde. he that sweetest rose will find must find loves prick and rosalinde. this is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect yourself with them?  rosalind. peace, you dull fool! i found them on a tree.  touchstone. truly, the tree yields bad fruit.  rosalind. ill graff it with you, and then i shall graff it with a medlar. then it will be the earliest fruit i th country; for youll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and thats the right virtue of the medlar.  touchstone. you have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge. enter celia, with a writing  rosalind. peace! here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.  celia.why should this a desert be? for it is unpeopled? no;  tongues ill hang on every tree that shall civil sayings show.  some, how brief the life of man runs his erring pilgrimage,  that the streching of a span buckles in his sum of age;  some, of violated vows twixt the souls of friend and friend;  but upon the fairest boughs, or at every sentence end,  will i rosalinda write, teaching all that read to know  the quintessence of every sprite heaven would in little show.  therefore heaven nature chargd that one body should be filld  with all graces wide-enlargd. nature presently distilld  helens cheek, but not her heart, cleopatras majesty,  atalantas better part, sad lucretias modesty.  thus rosalinde of many parts by heavenly synod was devisd,  of many faces, eyes, and hearts, to have the touches dearest prizd.  heaven would that she these gifts should have,  and i to live and die her slave.  rosalind. o most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried have patience, good people.  celia. how now! back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with him, sirrah.  touchstone. come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat; though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage. exeunt corin and touchstone  celia. didst thou hear these verses?  rosalind. o, yes, i heard them all, and more too; for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.  celia. thats no matter; the feet might bear the verses.  rosalind. ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.  celia. but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hangd and carved upon these trees?  rosalind. i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what i found on a palm-tree. i was never so berhymd since pythagoras time that i was an irish rat, which i can hardly remember.  celia. trow you who hath done this?  rosalind. is it a man?  celia. and a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. change you colour?  rosalind. i prithee, who?  celia. o lord, lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be removd with earthquakes, and so encounter.  rosalind. nay, but who is it?  celia. is it possible?  rosalind. nay, i prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.  celia. o wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!  rosalind. good my complexion! dost thou think, though i am caparisond like a man, i have a doublet and hose in my disposition? one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery. i prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. i would thou couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceald man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouthd bottle- either too much at once or none at all. i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that i may drink thy tidings.  celia. so you may put a man in your belly.  rosalind. is he of gods making? what manner of man? is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?  celia. nay, he hath but a little beard.  rosalind. why, god will send more if the man will be thankful. let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.  celia. it is young orlando, that trippd up the wrestlers heels and your heart both in an instant.  rosalind. nay, but the devil take mocking! speak sad brow and true maid.  celia. i faith, coz, tis he.  rosalind. orlando?  celia. orlando.  rosalind. alas the day! what shall i do with my doublet and hose? what did he when thou sawst him? what said he? how lookd he? wherein went he? what makes he here? did he ask for me? where remains he? how parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see him again? answer me in one word.  celia. you must borrow me gargantuas mouth first; tis a word too great for any mouth of this ages size. to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.  rosalind. but doth he know that i am in this forest, and in mans apparel? looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?  celia. it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. i found him under a tree, like a droppd acorn.  rosalind. it may well be calld joves tree, when it drops forth such fruit.  celia. give me audience, good madam.  rosalind. proceed.  celia. there lay he, stretchd along like a wounded knight.  rosalind. though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.  celia. cry holla to thy tongue, i prithee; it curvets unseasonably. he was furnishd like a hunter.  rosalind. o, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.  celia. i would sing my song without a burden; thou bringst me out of tune.  rosalind. do you not know i am a woman? when i think, i must speak. sweet, say on.  celia. you bring me out. soft! comes he not here? enter orlando and jaques  rosalind. tis he; slink by, and note him.  jaques. i thank you for your company; but, good faith, i had as lief have been myself alone.  orlando. and so had i; but yet, for fashion sake, i thank you too for your society.  jaques. god buy you; lets meet as little as we can.  orlando. i do desire we may be better strangers.  jaques. i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.  orlando. i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.  jaques. rosalind is your loves name?  orlando. yes, just.  jaques. i do not like her name.  orlando. there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christend.  jaques. what stature is she of?  orlando. just as high as my heart.  jaques. you are full of pretty answers. have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives, and connd them out of rings?  orlando. not so; but i answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions.  jaques. you have a nimble wit; i think twas made of atalantas heels. will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all our misery.  orlando. i will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom i know most faults.  jaques. the worst fault you have is to be in love.  orlando. tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue. i am weary of you.  jaques. by my troth, i was seeking for a fool when i found you.  orlando. he is drownd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see him.  jaques. there i shall see mine own figure.  orlando. which i take to be either a fool or a cipher.  jaques. ill tarry no longer with you; farewell, good signior love.  orlando. i am glad of your departure; adieu, good monsieur melancholy.  exit jaques  rosalind. [aside to celia] i will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him.- do you hear, forester?  orlando. very well; what would you?  rosalind. i pray you, what ist oclock?  orlando. you should ask me what time o day; theres no clock in the forest.  rosalind. then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.  orlando. and why not the swift foot of time? had not that been as proper?  rosalind. by no means, sir. time travels in divers paces with divers persons. ill tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.  orlando. i prithee, who doth he trot withal?  rosalind. marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnizd; if the interim be but a sennight, times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.  orlando. who ambles time withal?  rosalind. with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. these time ambles withal.  orlando. who doth he gallop withal?  rosalind. with a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.  orlando. who stays it still withal?  rosalind. with lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.  orlando. where dwell you, pretty youth?  rosalind. with this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.  orlando. are you native of this place?  rosalind. as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.  orlando. your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.  rosalind. i have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. i have heard him read many lectures against it; and i thank god i am not a woman, to be touchd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxd their whole sex withal.  orlando. can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?  rosalind. there were none principal; they were all like one another as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow-fault came to match it.  orlando. i prithee recount some of them.  rosalind. no; i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of rosalind. if i could meet that fancy-monger, i would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.  orlando. i am he that is so love-shakd; i pray you tell me your remedy.  rosalind. there is none of my uncles marks upon you; he taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner.  orlando. what were his marks?  rosalind. a lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not; but i pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue. then your hose should be ungarterd, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttond, your shoe untied, and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation. but you are no such man; you are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.  orlando. fair youth, i would i could make thee believe i love.  rosalind. me believe it! you may as soon make her that you love believe it; which, i warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she does. that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. but, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired?  orlando. i swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of rosalind, i am that he, that unfortunate he.  rosalind. but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?  orlando. neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.  rosalind. love is merely a madness; and, i tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punishd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. yet i profess curing it by counsel.  orlando. did you ever cure any so?  rosalind. yes, one; and in this manner. he was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and i set him every day to woo me; at which time would i, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic. and thus i curd him; and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in t.  orlando. i would not be cured, youth.  rosalind. i would cure you, if you would but call me rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me.  orlando. now, by the faith of my love, i will. tell me where it is.  rosalind. go with me to it, and ill show it you; and, by the way, you shall tell me where in the forest you live. will you go?  orlando. with all my heart, good youth.  rosalind. nay, you must call me rosalind. come, sister, will you go?exeuntscene iii.the forestenter touchstone and audrey; jaques behind  touchstone. come apace, good audrey; i will fetch up your goats, audrey. and how, audrey, am i the man yet? doth my simple feature content you?  audrey. your features! lord warrant us! what features?  touchstone. i am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest ovid, was among the goths.  jaques. [aside] o knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than jove in a thatchd house!  touchstone. when a mans verses cannot be understood, nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. truly, i would the gods had made thee poetical.  audrey. i do not know what poetical is. is it honest in deed and word? is it a true thing?  touchstone. no, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.  audrey. do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?  touchstone. i do, truly, for thou swearst to me thou art honest; now, if thou wert a poet, i might have some hope thou didst feign.  audrey. would you not have me honest?  touchstone. no, truly, unless thou wert hard-favourd; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.  jaques. [aside] a material fool!  audrey. well, i am not fair; and therefore i pray the gods make me honest.  touchstone. truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.  audrey. i am not a slut, though i thank the gods i am foul.  touchstone. well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter. but be it as it may be, i will marry thee; and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promisd to meet me in this place of the forest, and to couple us.  jaques. [aside] i would fain see this meeting.  audrey. well, the gods give us joy!  touchstone. amen. a man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. but what though? courage! as horns are odious, they are necessary. it is said: many a man knows no end of his goods. right! many a man has good horns and knows no end of them. well, that is the dowry of his wife; tis none of his own getting. horns? even so. poor men alone? no, no; the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. is the single man therefore blessed? no; as a walld town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. here comes sir oliver.  enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext, you are well met. will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?  martext. is there none here to give the woman?  touchstone. i will not take her on gift of any man.  martext. truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.  jaques. [discovering himself] proceed, proceed; ill give her.  touchstone. good even, good master what-ye-callt; how do you, sir? you are very well met. goddild you for your last company. i am very glad to see you. even a toy in hand here, sir. nay; pray be coverd.  jaques. will you be married, motley?  touchstone. as the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.  jaques. and will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush, like a beggar? get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.  touchstone. [aside] i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.  jaques. go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.  touchstone. come, sweet audrey; we must be married or we must live in bawdry. farewell, good master oliver. not-o sweet oliver,o brave oliver,  leave me not behind thee. but-  wind away,begone, i say,  i will not to wedding with thee.exeunt jaques, touchstone, and audrey  martext. tis no matter; neer a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.  exitscene iv.the forestenter rosalind and celia  rosalind. never talk to me; i will weep.  celia. do, i prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.  rosalind. but have i not cause to weep?  celia. as good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.  rosalind. his very hair is of the dissembling colour.  celia. something browner than judass. marry, his kisses are judass own children.  rosalind. i faith, his hair is of a good colour.  celia. an excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.  rosalind. and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.  celia. he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana. a nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them.  rosalind. but why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?  celia. nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.  rosalind. do you think so?  celia. yes; i think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but for his verity in love, i do think him as concave as covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.  rosalind. not true in love?  celia. yes, when he is in; but i think he is not in.  rosalind. you have heard him swear downright he was.  celia. was is not is; besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer of false reckonings. he attends here in the forest on the duke, your father.  rosalind. i met the duke yesterday, and had much question with him. he asked me of what parentage i was; i told him, of as good as he; so he laughd and let me go. but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando?  celia. o, thats a brave man! he writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose. but alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides. who comes here? enter corin  corin. mistress and master, you have oft enquired after the shepherd that complaind of love, who you saw sitting by me on the turf, praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress.  celia. well, and what of him?  corin. if you will see a pageant truly playd between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain, go hence a little, and i shall conduct you, if you will mark it.  rosalind. o, come, let us remove! the sight of lovers feedeth those in love. bring us to this sight, and you shall say ill prove a busy actor in their play. exeuntscene v.another part of the forestenter silvius and phebe  silvius. sweet phebe, do not scorn me; do not, phebe. say that you love me not; but say not so in bitterness. the common executioner, whose heart th accustomd sight of death makes hard, falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon. will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops? enter rosalind, celia, and corin, at a distance  phebe. i would not be thy executioner; i fly thee, for i would not injure thee. thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye. tis pretty, sure, and very probable, that eyes, that are the frailst and softest things, who shut their coward gates on atomies, should be calld tyrants, butchers, murderers! now i do frown on thee with all my heart; and if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee. now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down; or, if thou canst not, o, for shame, for shame, lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers. now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee. scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains some scar of it; lean upon a rush, the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes, which i have darted at thee, hurt thee not; nor, i am sure, there is not force in eyes that can do hurt.  silvius. o dear phebe, if ever- as that ever may be near- you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, then shall you know the wounds invisible that loves keen arrows make.  phebe. but till that time come not thou near me; and when that time comes, afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not; as till that time i shall not pity thee.  rosalind. [advancing] and why, i pray you? who might be yourmother, that you insult, exult, and all at once, over the wretched? what though you have no beauty- as, by my faith, i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed- must you be therefore proud and pitiless? why, what means this? why do you look on me? i see no more in you than in the ordinary of natures sale-work. ods my little life, i think she means to tangle my eyes too! no faith, proud mistress, hope not after it; tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream, that can entame my spirits to your worship. you foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her, like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain? you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman. tis such fools as you that makes the world full of ill-favourd children. tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her; and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her. but, mistress, know yourself. down on your knees, and thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love; for i must tell you friendly in your ear: sell when you can; you are not for all markets. cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer; foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer. so take her to thee, shepherd. fare you well.  phebe. sweet youth, i pray you chide a year together; i had rather hear you chide than this man woo.  rosalind. hes falln in love with your foulness, and shell fall in love with my anger. if it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, ill sauce her with bitter words. why look you so upon me?  phebe. for no ill will i bear you.  rosalind. i pray you do not fall in love with me, for i am falser than vows made in wine; besides, i like you not. if you will know my house, tis at the tuft of olives here hard by. will you go, sister? shepherd, ply her hard. come, sister. shepherdess, look on him better, and be not proud; though all the world could see, none could be so abusd in sight as he. come, to our flock.  exeunt rosalind, celia, and corin  phebe. dead shepherd, now i find thy saw of might: who ever lovd that lovd not at first sight?  silvius. sweet phebe.  phebe. ha! what sayst thou, silvius?  silvius. sweet phebe, pity me.  phebe. why, i arn sorry for thee, gentle silvius.  silvius. wherever sorrow is, relief would be. if you do sorrow at my grief in love, by giving love, your sorrow and my grief were both extermind.  phebe. thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?  silvius. i would have you.  phebe. why, that were covetousness. silvius, the time was that i hated thee; and yet it is not that i bear thee love; but since that thou canst talk of love so well, thy company, which erst was irksome to me, i will endure; and ill employ thee too. but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employd.  silvius. so holy and so perfect is my love, and i in such a poverty of grace, that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps; loose now and then a scattred smile, and that ill live upon.  phebe. knowst thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?  silvius. not very well; but i have met him oft; and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of.  phebe. think not i love him, though i ask for him; tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well. but what care i for words? yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear. it is a pretty youth- not very pretty; but, sure, hes proud; and yet his pride becomes him. hell make a proper man. the best thing in him is his complexion; and faster than his tongue did make offence, his eye did heal it up. he is not very tall; yet for his years hes tall; his leg is but so-so; and yet tis well. there was a pretty redness in his lip, a little riper and more lusty red than that mixd in his cheek; twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask. there be some women, silvius, had they markd him in parcels as i did, would have gone near to fall in love with him; but, for my part, i love him not, nor hate him not; and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him; for what had he to do to chide at me? he said mine eyes were black, and my hair black, and, now i am remembred, scornd at me. i marvel why i answerd not again; but thats all one: omittance is no quittance. ill write to him a very taunting letter, and thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, silvius?  silvius. phebe, with all my heart.  phebe. ill write it straight; the matters in my head and in my heart; i will be bitter with him and passing short. go with me, silvius. exeunt<<this electronic version of the complete works of williamshakespeare is copyright 1990-1993 by world library, inc., and isprovided by project gutenberg etext of carnegie mellon universitywith permission.  electronic and machine readable copies may bedistributed so long as such copies (1) are for your or otherspersonal use only, and (2) are not distributed or usedcommercially.  prohibited commercial distribution includes by anyservice that charges for download time or for membership.>>'},\n",

[exit jaques] why, how now, orlando! where have you been all this while? you a lover! an you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.  orlando. my fair rosalind, i come within an hour of my promise.  rosalind. break an hours promise in love! he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that cupid hath clappd him o th shoulder, but ill warrant him heart-whole.  orlando. pardon me, dear rosalind.  rosalind. nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. i had as lief be wood of a snail.  orlando. of a snail!  rosalind. ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head- a better jointure, i think, than you make a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.  orlando. whats that?  rosalind. why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents the slander of his wife.  orlando. virtue is no horn-maker; and my rosalind is virtuous.  rosalind. and i am your rosalind.  celia. it pleases him to call you so; but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you.  rosalind. come, woo me, woo me; for now i am in a holiday humour, and like enough to consent. what would you say to me now, an i were your very very rosalind?  orlando. i would kiss before i spoke.  rosalind. nay, you were better speak first; and when you were gravelld for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking- god warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.  orlando. how if the kiss be denied?  rosalind. then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.  orlando. who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?  rosalind. marry, that should you, if i were your mistress; or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit.  orlando. what, of my suit?  rosalind. not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. am not i your rosalind?  orlando. i take some joy to say you are, because i would be talking of her.  rosalind. well, in her person, i say i will not have you.  orlando. then, in mine own person, i die.  rosalind. no, faith, die by attorney. the poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. troilus had his brains dashd out with a grecian club; yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. leander, he would have livd many a fair year, though hero had turnd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont, and, being taken with the cramp, was drownd; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was- hero of sestos. but these are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.  orlando. i would not have my right rosalind of this mind; for, i protest, her frown might kill me.  rosalind. by this hand, it will not kill a fly. but come, now i will be your rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me what you will, i will grant it.  orlando. then love me, rosalind.  rosalind. yes, faith, will i, fridays and saturdays, and all.  orlando. and wilt thou have me?  rosalind. ay, and twenty such.  orlando. what sayest thou?  rosalind. are you not good?  orlando. i hope so.  rosalind. why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? come, sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. give me your hand, orlando. what do you say, sister?  orlando. pray thee, marry us.  celia. i cannot say the words.  rosalind. you must begin will you, orlando-  celia. go to. will you, orlando, have to wife this rosalind?  orlando. i will.  rosalind. ay, but when?  orlando. why, now; as fast as she can marry us.  rosalind. then you must say i take thee, rosalind, for wife.  orlando. i take thee, rosalind, for wife.  rosalind. i might ask you for your commission; but- i do take thee, orlando, for my husband. theres a girl goes before the priest; and, certainly, a womans thought runs before her actions.  orlando. so do all thoughts; they are wingd.  rosalind. now tell me how long you would have her, after you have possessd her.  orlando. for ever and a day.  rosalind. say a day without the ever. no, no, orlando; men are april when they woo, december when they wed: maids are may when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. i will weep for nothing, like diana in the fountain, and i will do that when you are disposd to be merry; i will laugh like a hyen, and that when thou are inclind to sleep.  orlando. but will my rosalind do so?  rosalind. by my life, she will do as i do.  orlando. o, but she is wise.  rosalind. or else she could not have the wit to do this. the wiser, the waywarder. make the doors upon a womans wit, and it will out at the casement; shut that, and twill out at the key-hole; stop that, twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.  orlando. a man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say wit, whither wilt? rosalind. nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed.  orlando. and what wit could wit have to excuse that?  rosalind. marry, to say she came to seek you there. you shall never take her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue. o, that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool!  orlando. for these two hours, rosalind, i will leave thee.  rosalind. alas, dear love, i cannot lack thee two hours!  orlando. i must attend the duke at dinner; by two oclock i will be with thee again.  rosalind. ay, go your ways, go your ways. i knew what you would prove; my friends told me as much, and i thought no less. that flattering tongue of yours won me. tis but one cast away, and so, come death! two oclock is your hour?  orlando. ay, sweet rosalind.  rosalind. by my troth, and in good earnest, and so god mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, i will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind, that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.  orlando. with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind; so, adieu.  rosalind. well, time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time try. adieu. exit orlando  celia. you have simply misusd our sex in your love-prate. we must have your doublet and hose pluckd over your head, and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.  rosalind. o coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love! but it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the bay of portugal.  celia. or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.  rosalind. no; that same wicked bastard of venus, that was begot of thought, conceivd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind rascally boy, that abuses every ones eyes, because his own are out- let him be judge how deep i am in love. ill tell thee, aliena, i cannot be out of the sight of orlando. ill go find a shadow, and sigh till he come.  celia. and ill sleep. exeuntscene ii.the forest  enter jaques and lords, in the habit of foresters  jaques. which is he that killed the deer?  lord. sir, it was i.  jaques. lets present him to the duke, like a roman conqueror; and it would do well to set the deers horns upon his head for a branch of victory. have you no song, forester, for this purpose?  lord. yes, sir.  jaques. sing it; tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.  song.what shall he have that killd the deer?his leather skin and horns to wear.[the rest shall hear this burden:]  then sing him home.take thou no scorn to wear the horn;it was a crest ere thou wast born.  thy fathers father wore it;  and thy father bore it.the horn, the horn, the lusty horn,is not a thing to laugh to scorn. exeuntscene iii.the forestenter rosalind and celia  rosalind. how say you now? is it not past two oclock? and here much orlando!  celia. i warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath taen his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. look, who comes here. enter silvius  silvius. my errand is to you, fair youth; my gentle phebe did bid me give you this. i know not the contents; but, as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it, it bears an angry tenour. pardon me, i am but as a guiltless messenger.  rosalind. patience herself would startle at this letter, and play the swaggerer. bear this, bear all. she says i am not fair, that i lack manners; she calls me proud, and that she could not love me, were man as rare as phoenix. ods my will! her love is not the hare that i do hunt; why writes she so to me? well, shepherd, well, this is a letter of your own device.  silvius. no, i protest, i know not the contents; phebe did write it.  rosalind. come, come, you are a fool, and turnd into the extremity of love. i saw her hand; she has a leathern hand, a freestone-colourd hand; i verily did think that her old gloves were on, but twas her hands; she has a huswifes hand- but thats no matter. i say she never did invent this letter: this is a mans invention, and his hand.  silvius. sure, it is hers.  rosalind. why, tis a boisterous and a cruel style; a style for challengers. why, she defies me, like turk to christian. womens gentle brain could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, such ethiope words, blacker in their effect than in their countenance. will you hear the letter?  silvius. so please you, for i never heard it yet; yet heard too much of phebes cruelty.  rosalind. she phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.[reads]art thou god to shepherd turnd,that a maidens heart hath burnd? can a woman rail thus?  silvius. call you this railing?  rosalind. why, thy godhead laid apart, warrst thou with a womans heart? did you ever hear such railing?whiles the eye of man did woo me,that could do no vengeance to me. meaning me a beast.if the scorn of your bright eynehave power to raise such love in mine,alack, in me what strange effectwould they work in mild aspect!whiles you chid me, i did love;how then might your prayers move!he that brings this love to thelittle knows this love in me;and by him seal up thy mind,whether that thy youth and kindwill the faithful offer takeof me and all that i can make;or else by him my love deny,and then ill study how to die.  silvius. call you this chiding?  celia. alas, poor shepherd!  rosalind. do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. wilt thou love such a woman? what, to make thee an instrument, and play false strains upon thee! not to be endurd! well, go your way to her, for i see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her- that if she love me, i charge her to love thee; if she will not, i will never have her unless thou entreat for her. if you be a true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company. exit silvius enter oliver  oliver. good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know, where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheep-cote fencd about with olive trees?  celia. west of this place, down in the neighbour bottom. the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place. but at this hour the house doth keep itself; theres none within.  oliver. if that an eye may profit by a tongue, then should i know you by description- such garments, and such years: the boy is fair, of female favour, and bestows himself like a ripe sister; the woman low, and browner than her brother. are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for?  celia. it is no boast, being askd, to say we are.  oliver. orlando doth commend him to you both; and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin. are you he?  rosalind. i am. what must we understand by this?  oliver. some of my shame; if you will know of me what man i am, and how, and why, and where, this handkercher was staind.  celia. i pray you, tell it.  oliver. when last the young orlando parted from you, he left a promise to return again within an hour; and, pacing through the forest, chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside, and mark what object did present itself. under an oak, whose boughs were mossd with age, and high top bald with dry antiquity, a wretched ragged man, oergrown with hair, lay sleeping on his back. about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathd itself, who with her head nimble in threats approachd the opening of his mouth; but suddenly, seeing orlando, it unlinkd itself, and with indented glides did slip away into a bush; under which bushs shade a lioness, with udders all drawn dry, lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch, when that the sleeping man should stir; for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead. this seen, orlando did approach the man, and found it was his brother, his elder brother.  celia. o, i have heard him speak of that same brother; and he did render him the most unnatural that livd amongst men.  oliver. and well he might so do, for well i know he was unnatural.  rosalind. but, to orlando: did he leave him there, food to the suckd and hungry lioness?  oliver. twice did he turn his back, and purposd so; but kindness, nobler ever than revenge, and nature, stronger than his just occasion, made him give battle to the lioness, who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awakd.  celia. are you his brother?

 oliver. by and by. when from the first to last, betwixt us two, tears our recountments had most kindly bathd, as how i came into that desert place- in brief, he led me to the gentle duke, who gave me fresh array and entertainment, committing me unto my brothers love; who led me instantly unto his cave, there strippd himself, and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away, which all this while had bled; and now he fainted, and cried, in fainting, upon rosalind. brief, i recoverd him, bound up his wound, and, after some small space, being strong at heart, he sent me hither, stranger as i am, to tell this story, that you might excuse his broken promise, and to give this napkin, dyd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind.

 william. faith, sir, so so.  touchstone. so so is good, very good, very excellent good; and yet it is not; it is but so so. art thou wise?  william. ay, sir, i have a pretty wit.  touchstone. why, thou sayst well. i do now remember a saying:the fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. the heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. you do love this maid?  william. i do, sir.  touchstone. give me your hand. art thou learned?  william. no, sir.  touchstone. then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being pourd out of cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for i am he.  william. which he, sir?

that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?  oliver. neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me, i love aliena; say with her that she loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. it shall be to your good; for my fathers house and all the revenue that was old sir rowlands will i estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.  orlando. you have my consent. let your wedding be to-morrow. thither will i invite the duke and alls contented followers. go you and prepare aliena; for, look you, here comes my rosalind.enter rosalind  rosalind. god save you, brother.  oliver. and you, fair sister.  exit  rosalind. o, my dear orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf!  orlando. it is my arm.  rosalind. i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.  orlando. wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.  rosalind. did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showd me your handkercher?  orlando. ay, and greater wonders than that.  rosalind. o, i know where you are. nay, tis true. there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesars thrasonical brag of i came, saw, and overcame. for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they lookd; no sooner lookd but they lovd; no sooner lovd but they sighd; no sooner sighd but they askd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. they are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. clubs cannot part them.  orlando. they shall be married to-morrow; and i will bid the duke to the nuptial. but, o, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another mans eyes! by so much the more shall i to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.  rosalind. why, then, to-morrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind?  orlando. i can live no longer by thinking.  rosalind. i will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. know of me then- for now i speak to some purpose- that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit. i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch i say i know you are; neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. believe then, if you please, that i can do strange things. i have, since i was three year old, conversd with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her. i know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any danger.  orlando. speakst thou in sober meanings?  rosalind. by my life, i do; which i tender dearly, though i say i am a magician. therefore put you in your best array, bid your friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to rosalind, if you will.enter silvius and phebe look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.  phebe. youth, you have done me much ungentleness to show the letter that i writ to you.  rosalind. i care not if i have. it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you. you are there followd by a faithful shepherd; look upon him, love him; he worships you.  phebe. good shepherd, tell this youth what tis to love.  silvius. it is to be all made of sighs and tears; and so am i for phebe.  phebe. and i for ganymede.  orlando. and i for rosalind.  rosalind. and i for no woman.  silvius. it is to be all made of faith and service; and so am i for phebe.  phebe. and i for ganymede.  orlando. and i for rosalind.  rosalind. and i for no woman.  silvius. it is to be all made of fantasy, all made of passion, and all made of wishes; all adoration, duty, and observance, all humbleness, all patience, and impatience, all purity, all trial, all obedience; and so am i for phebe.  phebe. and so am i for ganymede.  orlando. and so am i for rosalind.  rosalind. and so am i for no woman.  phebe. if this be so, why blame you me to love you?  silvius. if this be so, why blame you me to love you?  orlando. if this be so, why blame you me to love you?  rosalind. why do you speak too, why blame you me to love you?  orlando. to her that is not here, nor doth not hear.  rosalind. pray you, no more of this; tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon. [to silvius] i will help you if i can. [to phebe] i would love you if i could.- to-morrow meet me all together. [ to phebe ] i will marry you if ever i marry woman, and ill be married to-morrow. [to orlando] i will satisfy you if ever i satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [to silvius] i will content you if what pleases you contents you, and you shall be married to-morrow. [to orlando] as you love rosalind, meet. [to silvius] as you love phebe, meet;- and as i love no woman, ill meet. so, fare you well; i have left you commands.  silvius. ill not fail, if i live.  phebe. nor i.  orlando. nor i.  exeuntscene iii.the forestenter touchstone and audrey  touchstone. to-morrow is the joyful day, audrey; to-morrow will we be married.  audrey. i do desire it with all my heart; and i hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. here come two of the banishd dukes pages. enter two pages  first page. well met, honest gentleman.  touchstone. by my troth, well met. come sit, sit, and a song.  second page. we are for you; sit i th middle.  first page. shall we clap intot roundly, without hawking, or spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?  second page. ifaith, ifaith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies on a horse. song.  it was a lover and his lass, with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,  that oer the green corn-field did pass in the spring time, the only pretty ring time,  when birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.  sweet lovers love the spring.  between the acres of the rye, with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,  these pretty country folks would lie, in the spring time, &c.  this carol they began that hour, with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,  how that a life was but a flower, in the spring time, &c.  and therefore take the present time, with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,  for love is crowned with the prime, in the spring time, &c.  touchstone. truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.  first page. you are deceivd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our time.  touchstone. by my troth, yes; i count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. god buy you; and god mend your voices. come, audrey.  exeuntscene iv.the forestenter duke senior, amiens, jaques, orlando, oliver, and celia  duke senior. dost thou believe, orlando, that the boy can do all this that he hath promised?  orlando. i sometimes do believe and sometimes do not: as those that fear they hope, and know they fear.enter rosalind, silvius, and phebe  rosalind. patience once more, whiles our compact is urgd: you say, if i bring in your rosalind, you will bestow her on orlando here?  duke senior. that would i, had i kingdoms to give with her.  rosalind. and you say you will have her when i bring her?  orlando. that would i, were i of all kingdoms king.  rosalind. you say youll marry me, if i be willing?  phebe. that will i, should i die the hour after.  rosalind. but if you do refuse to marry me, youll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?  phebe. so is the bargain.  rosalind. you say that youll have phebe, if she will?  silvius. though to have her and death were both one thing.  rosalind. i have promisd to make all this matter even. keep you your word, o duke, to give your daughter; you yours, orlando, to receive his daughter; keep your word, phebe, that youll marry me, or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd; keep your word, silvius, that youll marry her if she refuse me; and from hence i go, to make these doubts all even.exeunt rosalind and celia  duke senior. i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughters favour.  orlando. my lord, the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter. but, my good lord, this boy is forest-born, and hath been tutord in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle, whom he reports to be a great magician, obscured in the circle of this forest.  enter touchstone and audrey  jaques. there is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are calld fools.  touchstone. salutation and greeting to you all!  jaques. good my lord, bid him welcome. this is the motley-minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest. he hath been a courtier, he swears.  touchstone. if any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. i have trod a measure; i have flattred a lady; i have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; i have undone three tailors; i have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.  jaques. and how was that taen up?  touchstone. faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.  jaques. how seventh cause? good my lord, like this fellow.  duke senior. i like him very well.  touchstone. god ild you, sir; i desire you of the like. i press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. a poor virgin, sir, an ill-favourd thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.  duke senior. by my faith, he is very swift and sententious.  touchstone. according to the fools bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.  jaques. but, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?  touchstone. upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more seeming, audrey- as thus, sir. i did dislike the cut of a certain courtiers beard; he sent me word, if i said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. this is calld the retort courteous. if i sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. this is calld the quip modest. if again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. this is calld the reply churlish. if again it was not well cut, he would answer i spake not true. this is calld the reproof valiant. if again it was not well cut, he would say i lie. this is calld the countercheck quarrelsome. and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct.  jaques. and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?  touchstone. i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct; and so we measurd swords and parted.  jaques. can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?  touchstone. o, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have books for good manners. i will name you the degrees. the first, the retort courteous; the second, the quip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant; the fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance; the seventh, the lie direct. all these you may avoid but the lie direct; and you may avoid that too with an if. i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an if, as: if you said so, then i said so. and they shook hands, and swore brothers. your if is the only peace-maker; much virtue in if.  jaques. is not this a rare fellow, my lord? hes as good at any thing, and yet a fool.  duke senior. he uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit: enter hymen, rosalind, and celia. still music hymen. then is there mirth in heaven,  when earthly things made even atone together.  good duke, receive thy daughter;  hymen from heaven brought her, yea, brought her hither,  that thou mightst join her hand with his,  whose heart within his bosom is.  rosalind. [to duke] to you i give myself, for i am yours. [to orlando] to you i give myself, for i am yours.  duke senior. if there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.  orlando. if there be truth in sight, you are my rosalind.  phebe. if sight and shape be true, why then, my love adieu!  rosalind. ill have no father, if you be not he; ill have no husband, if you be not he; nor neer wed woman, if you be not she.  hymen. peace, ho! i bar confusion;tis i must make conclusion  of these most strange events.heres eight that must take handsto join in hymens bands,  if truth holds true contents.you and you no cross shall part;you and you are heart in heart;you to his love must accord,or have a woman to your lord;you and you are sure together,as the winter to foul weather.whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,feed yourselves with questioning,that reason wonder may diminish,how thus we met, and these things finish.  songwedding is great junos crown;  o blessed bond of board and bed!tis hymen peoples every town;  high wedlock then be honoured.honour, high honour, and renown,to hymen, god of every town!  duke senior. o my dear niece, welcome thou art to me! even daughter, welcome in no less degree.  phebe. i will not eat my word, now thou art mine; thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.  enter jaques de boys  jaques de boys. let me have audience for a word or two. i am the second son of old sir rowland, that bring these tidings to this fair assembly. duke frederick, hearing how that every day men of great worth resorted to this forest, addressd a mighty power; which were on foot, in his own conduct, purposely to take his brother here, and put him to the sword; and to the skirts of this wild wood he came, where, meeting with an old religious man, after some question with him, was converted both from his enterprise and from the world; his crown bequeathing to his banishd brother, and all their lands restord to them again that were with him exild. this to be true i do engage my life.  duke senior. welcome, young man. thou offerst fairly to thy brothers wedding: to one, his lands withheld; and to the other, a land itself at large, a potent dukedom. first, in this forest let us do those ends that here were well begun and well begot; and after, every of this happy number, that have endurd shrewd days and nights with us, shall share the good of our returned fortune, according to the measure of their states. meantime, forget this new-falln dignity, and fall into our rustic revelry. play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all, with measure heapd in joy, to th measures fall.  jaques. sir, by your patience. if i heard you rightly, the duke hath put on a religious life, and thrown into neglect the pompous court.  jaques de boys. he hath.  jaques. to him will i. out of these convertites there is much matter to be heard and learnd. [to duke] you to your former honour i bequeath; your patience and your virtue well deserves it. [to orlando] you to a love that your true faith doth merit; [to oliver] you to your land, and love, and great allies [to silvius] you to a long and well-deserved bed; [to touchstone] and you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage is but for two months victualld.- so to your pleasures; i am for other than for dancing measures.  duke senior. stay, jaques, stay.  jaques. to see no pastime i. what you would have ill stay to know at your abandond cave.exit  duke senior. proceed, proceed. we will begin these rites, as we do trust theyll end, in true delights. [a dance]exeuntepilogueepilogue.  rosalind. it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. if it be true that good wine needs no bush, tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. what a case am i in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! i am not furnishd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. my way is to conjure you; and ill begin with the women. i charge you, o women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you; and i charge you, o men, for the love you bear to women- as i perceive by your simpring none of you hates them- that between you and the women the play may please. if i were a woman, i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleasd me, complexions that likd me, and breaths that i defied not; and, i am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when i make curtsy, bid me farewell.the end}'}]"
